The Frontier War is over. After decades of conflict between the IMC and the militia founded to fight them, the region of space known as the Frontier can finally see peace.

But liberation can come at a cost: the Frontier worlds were left barren by the war, and promised aid dwindled to nothing. With no way to support themselves, those who remained had no choice but to leave their homes. The brave relocated to the Outlands.
 
A remote cluster of planets on the fringes of the Frontier, the Outlands are untouched by war and teeming with resources and opportunity. But life is cheap here, and danger lurks around every corner. Its pioneers, explorers, and outlaws used to spend their lives locked in an endless power struggle – now, they settle their differences in the Apex Games, a bloodsport where Legends from all corners of the Frontier compete for money, fame, and glory.

###**Syndicate**:

According to the newspapers they are the organization behind the Apex Games and responsible for ""bringing back life and order"" to the Outlands.
They also have a Rival in planet Talos


**King's Canyon**
 
* ""Once a simple settlement on the planet Solace dating back to the earliest expeditions to the Frontier, the island known as Kings Canyon didn't thrive until a century later, when the now-defunct IMC built several outposts centered around scientific research and development. In fact, it's rumored that the IMC conducted experiments using phase shift technology here, although explorers have yet to find any evidence that proves this. To blow off steam, IMC soldiers stationed here would compete in gladiator-esque combat in an area they nicknamed 'Thunderdome'. Years later, when the Syndicate commissioned the rebuilding of the island of Kings Canyon as the home of their newest bloodsport, they insisted Thunderdome remain untouched - a tribute to the earliest known predecessor of what we know today as 'The Apex Games'""

[An attack on King's Canyon](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/kings-canyon-map-update)


**Leviathans**

* ""Native to the Frontier, Leviathans roam the majority of planets that contain rich vegetation. Although classified as omnivores by the IMC’s Animal &amp; Wildlife Research Division, these 400 meter tall creatures mainly consume fruits and vegetables as their primary diet. The majestic Leviathan may seem intimidating due to its gigantic size, but they are hardly aggressive; considered only dangerous when in close proximity to highly populated areas due to overwhelming power of their movements. To protect research facilities, cities and colonies near Leviathan territories, the IMC developed Repulsor Towers (Dog-whistle towers) to emit high-frequency sounds that only Leviathans could hear, which kept the creatures at a safe distance. However if a tower were to fall, please evacuate quickly - your life may depend on it.""

The Leviathans are so large that they can affect the calculation of jump coordinates of a ship


###**Characters:**


**Bangalore**:

[Bio](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/about/characters/bangalore)

[Extra Story](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/about/characters/bangalore/story)

Newspaper Interview:

* ""I call him Jackie, but he’ll slap you sideways if you print that. Stick with Jackson. And he’s not gone. Always equip your Jump Kit first... That Pilot was a stickler for protocol, to the end. Not that it’s the end. I just hope he found some peace. Maybe settled down. He was always great with kids...taught me everything I know. He said sometimes you only have time to chamber a single round. So you have to know how to do it right. The last thing I said to him was he’s worried about nothing. Four and a half seconds later, I’m watching him-- he’s in skyfall. ‘Worried about nothing.’ Do you know how insufferable that boy will be, sitting on ‘I told you so’ for over a decade? I’ll never hear the end of it. Actually, know what? Print ‘Jackie’. It’ll drive him crazy. But this way, he’ll know it’s really me. Sometimes you only have time to chamber a single round. Got to do it right""


**Bloodhound:**

[Bio](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/about/characters/bloodhound)

Newspaper Interview:

* ""It is a gift to be an Apex Legend, but the true test is in the eyes of the Allfather. Each day brings me closer to honoring my felagi fighters who put have their lives ahead of my own. For them, I am prepared to face every challenge no matter what form the beast of the night chooses to take. As the prey stalks, the hunter hunts. Trust in nature, trust in yourself - that is the path to victory.""
        
**Caustic**

[Bio](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/about/characters/caustic)

[Extra Story](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/about/characters/caustic/story)

Newspaper Interview:

*  ""Yes, I’ve heard about criminals posing as Legends, and they’re as derivative as they are pathetic. Take this prison break. I admit there are similarities to my modus operandi, but the cloud formations… that’s where they went wrong. My gas wafts through the air as if dancing with death. Not like the spray of some hick fireman’s two-decade-old extinguisher, as shown here. Anybody with a tenth of my brain power can see this for what it is: amateurs playing dress-up in a desperate attempt to gain notoriety. But considering your banal, lackluster brand which you dare call ‘journalism’? A tenth of my intellect is giving you far too much credit. Do you have any more questions that might illuminate your ignorance? Very well. Enjoy your day.""

**Gibraltar**

[Bio](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/about/characters/makoa-gibraltar)

Newspaper Interview:

*  ""Being an Apex Legend takes courage, strength, and confidence...or as some call it, ‘Just being Gibraltar’ heh heh… We all put passion in our matches and fight like each day depends on it; my work with S.A.R.A.S. taught me that. You need to love what you do, care about what you do, and believe in your ability to do what you do; my parents taught me that. Finally, brothas, trust in those around you, protect those around you, and never forget that no matter how big you are, the world is always bigger; the Apex Games taught me that. Let’s go change a life!""

**Lifeline**

[Bio](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/about/characters/lifeline)

[Extra Story](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/about/characters/lifeline/story)

Newspaper Interview:

* ""They call us Legends… that’s good for them, but I couldn’t care less. I’m not here for the title. After the war, many people were left with nothing. If you ask me, it doesn’t matter what side they were on. We all had our own part in the war. No one is truly innocent, so we all deserve help. Like I said, I don’t care about the title, but don’t let that fool you, I am here to win...for them. The Legends are out there...they just don’t know it yet.""

**Mirage**

[Bio](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/about/characters/mirage)

[Extra Story](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/about/characters/mirage/story)

Newspaper Interview:

* ""Why did I become a Legend? One reason: women. I kid. Real reason? Beautiful women.  Sorry. They say I use humor as a defense mechanism, but hello... self-deprecation is my defense mechanism. Humor’s my crutch.  Or maybe my fallback? I don’t know, one of those. I guess at the end of the day, the Games give people a reason to cheer. Aren’t a whole lot of those left in the Outlands these days. Cool to be part of that. All I have to do is die young. So…yeah…anyhoo, I’m just pulling your leg, it’s totally for the babes.""

**Octane**

[Bio](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/about/characters/octane)

Newspaper Interview:

*  ""Where did you get this photo? I’ve never seen this before. Do you know, I remember everything about this moment. Know what I’m thinking here? Not ‘I can’t feel my legs’ or ‘are those my feet dangling by the bone?’. No, I’m thinking how cool it is that thousands of people are cheering for me, and they’re still not as loud as the heartbeat in my ears. Tha-THUM. Tha-THUM. Tha-THUM. That was the moment I realized: life isn’t worth living, if you don’t know this feeling. Mind if I keep this, compadre? I love this shot. This was the single greatest day of my life. Mi cumpleaños. The day I was born.""


**Pathfinder**

[Bio](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/about/characters/pathfinder)

[Extra Story](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/about/characters/pathfinder/story)

Newspaper Interview:

* ""I’m Marvin, but my best friends call me Pathfinder. I love being an Apex Legend because that means my banner is on display for everyone in the Outlands to see, especially my creator whoever they are. Competing alongside so many skilled fighters each match is really cool and it makes me very excited to know that I am everyone’s favorite squadmate to fight with; my friend Mirage told me that. He also said that I don’t get sarcasm, which was also nice to hear...I think.""

**Wraith**

[Bio](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/about/characters/wraith)

Newspaper Interview:

* ""I’ve seen a world where I’m not a Legend… and I’ve seen a world where I am. We all make choices in our lives, every second, every day, and those choices...they define us, but they don’t control us. We are our future, not our past. No matter what choice you make, the world you’re in is the world you chose…  Accept it. One day you’re a Legend, the next you’re something else. So be it, nothing will control me.""


**Wattson**

[Extra Story](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/about/characters/wattson/story)

Newspaper Interview:

*  ""After the funeral, I stood in our kitchen, and it was so... quiet. I had dreamt of quiet like that, but now that I had it, I was terrified. And alone.  I sat on the floor, and I know how silly this sounds, but I hid under the table. That was where they found me. Anita. Makoa. Ajay. Even Dr. Caustic, and he hates everybody. They’d just as soon stab each other in the back. Or the front. But they put that all aside. To support me. The electrician’s kid.  I thought I knew what family was. But my equations were incomplete. My family is here. At the Games. And now it’s my turn to support them.  With every last charge in me.""",1

The difference is someone on a monitor has the advantage due to response times. For example let’s just say you and someone else with equal skill are in a 1v1 same guns and all. The person with the monitor would win.

I would go into detail but I wanna make this as short as possible. If your tv has the setting put it in game mode when playing apex or any other game to get the response time as close to 1ms as possible. A lot of monitors have 1ms response times and TVs are like 30ms sometimes even higher. 

If you think I’m lying or wasting your time get on youtube and research response times. Just a quick tip for anyone who likes to be competitive but constantly feel like they’re at a disadvantage",1

This sounded ridiculous to me. I thought it was an unwritten rule that when she uses it that she gets first pick and everyone else can have what’s left. She is using her ult, her resources to call in items so she should get first pick not some free for all. To my surprise a couple of my friends, neither Lifeline mains for full disclosure, actually agree that since it’s intensely team based that she has no more right to it than anyone else on her team.

Here's one that always pops into my head. A squad and I fought our way out of being pinched between 3 teams on low ground near airbase. It was a 4 team fight we got 6 of the 9 potential kills there.  My level 20 and 40 squadmates really surprised me. Final squad was one octane and I could tell he was high-tailing it to the bunker spawn beacon. I knew there was plenty of loot for the enemies in that little town behind bunker because that's where a majority of the fights took place. It was an easy win, right? Nah, when I ping in that direction and take a look at my squad, they're running toward a care package (they hadn't healed yet). I know we all have fully purple loot, so I type, ""1 guy left, he ran to respawn"" and start heading to it. I see the drop-ship and get a little nervous. My team is still healing and slowly walking to the airbase care package. I rapidly ping the ship and the Caustic on my team responds by pinging the hell out of the package. I open my chatbox again and type, ""They have no guns, lets p"". 

I was cut off by a kraber shot to the head. Instead of letting me crawl to cover, Pathfinder revives me in the open. He takes a body shot and cancels the pickup. I find cover, but the ring has been closing the whole time. Caustic who's down in airbase blindly throws his ultimate. The rest happens just like you'd think. I die to storm, team gets shot up running to get in the ring.  The only reason I remember this match is because it was my highest kill game at the time. All said and done, I did learn many valuable lessons in those short 4 minutes, so it wasn't a total waste.",1

Well I found out some pretty dope shit today when I loaded up the game. I wanted to play with some tunes, so I had ""Ready to Die, by Andrew W.K"" ready to go on Spotify. I started the song nearly the same second as the intro cutscene began, and...OH Boy, did they sync! Not just the music to the action, but the lyrics were describing several of the scenes in real time! An example is when Octane dies, the music starts to go a little slower, and the lyrics say something like, ""your life is over now, your time is running out."" And right as he gets revived they say, something like, ""so buckle up and take a stand, CUZ NOW ITS TIME TO KILL AGAIN!"" Fuck, I just couldn't get over how perfect it was, so check it out. Maybe someone could make a music video, I mean it's already perfect, all it needs is the track to be overlayed.

133,I think we need a light ammo LMG.,1564066485.0,24,"So while getting my face stomped in last night playing with my buddies I was thinking about what kind of new gun I would love to see added to this game. The weapon selection for the most part is well balanced and has a nice spread of types. Shotguns heavy rifles and machine guns even a PDW style firearm, excellent close range light fast and shredding SMGs etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a gun guy IRL so while others may worry about numbers and balance, ultimates, tacticals, how fast something charges back up or how long something lasts, I just think about what new rooty tooty point and shootys we could be playing with. (Very similar to my life my wife looks for responsible things like pots pans clothes I just look at all the cool guns at my job and debate how to best convince her to let me buy one.) 

&amp;#x200B;

What we dont have is a light ammo LMG. Something akin to the M249/FN MINIMI. High rate of fire, easy to manouver (for an LMG) slightly better hip fire than the Spitfire, and a hefty magazine. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lets say ROF similar to the R-301 possibly slightly lower than that to not make it too much of a bullet hose. 

**Damage**

13 Body 

20 Head

This puts it pretty squarely right in between the SMG and AR platforms for light ammo variants. 

**Attachments**

Muzzle

Mag

Optic

Stock  

Standard magazine size of 40 up to the level 3 limit of 75

**ADS movement penalty** of  X.4 slightly slower than the AR but not as much as the Spitfire or Devotion. Since this will be a softer hitting and not as clunky option in this category. Or even just keep it .4 for balance sake. 

&amp;#x200B;

Great 30-50m engagements and still able to push out to the 150m mark pretty handily but falls off sharply after that. Planting this idea squarely into the medium to medium close engagement range. Gives you the ability to apply pressure at these closer ranges while still having some amount of maneuverability.

&amp;#x200B;

Just something I got thinking about and cooked up. Even thought up a possible name for it Ripcord.

&amp;#x200B;

Wanted to put it out there and see if anyone had any ideas liked this or whatever. Plus writing this gave me a nice break from work while still looking like I am actually doing something. Love to get some feedback and see what the rest of you all have to say!",1

Our fix for this so far is to leave party and re-invite each other and it seems to work. It's just kind of annoying having to do it every match.

[Just a concept using in-game weapons.](https://i.redd.it/tr5kopwiakc31.jpg)

So I have an idea for a new weapon:

An Energy Shotgun, with a special ability.

The Ability would be the longer you hold down the fire button, the bigger the burst of energy is. So rapid fire would do average damage in close range, while a long hold would be good a mid-range. There would be a time limit to holding down fire, which would cause the gun to fire.

Uses Energy Ammo and has 2 attachments and a Hop-Up.

The attachments and Hop-Up would be:

Shotgun Bolt, Scope, and Select Fire.

Select Fire would affect the ability on the weapon by making the gun rapid fire. It would turn into an automatic weapon with a base range of damage, unlike the regular fire that has a wide variety of damage.",1

(My condolences to the fella who opens it on the first aid side because there was a level 3 body shield over here and it's sure cozy).


I'm asking because of obvious conflict in-game with players who bitch me out for taking ONE of ""their"" items and really ruin the experience by creating a hostility the rest of the game (give-or-take being shunned/ignored/cursed-out entirely afterwards). But maybe I'm assuming the wrong position?


I pretty much exclusively play as Lifeline because I like being an of-aid character. Anytime I drop a Care Package (which I try to as often as possible by eating up Excellerants), I always have the notion of my teammates benefiting either more, less, or as equally as I am by the super being activated depending on the situation/loot/location.


I digress - but what's your guys' stance as either players who enjoy playing with Lifelines or playing as Lifelines?

I’ve been playing this game since it basically first came out. I fell in love with the gameplay and high action team fights. When comp came out I was pretty excited since I was getting bored of the same old thing over and over and wanted a more competitive experience. I loved it up until I hit the platinum rank, and the camping problem really showed itself. Every time we would reach the end of a match there would be 10 teams in a relatively small circle. If me and my other team mate got downed, my third would run away and camp for placement points.  I just played a game where I was downed, and my teammates watched as I got finished by a solo. I took his shield off and he could’ve easily been taken down but my teammates didn’t want to give their spot up. I feel like this problem could easily be fixed by giving players more points for kills or even points for reviving teammates. I just don’t like how the whole match is just a camp fest where leaving your teammates is better so you can get points.

Obviously some characters would have an advantage like Caustic Bangalore and Gibby being having tactical and ults that eeal damage while mirage and wraith can get away from situations of flank. So pathfinder an octane would be most useful for punches as they can get to places quicker.

Idk about lifeline. I feel like she's either very useful or very useless in a situation. There is no in-between. But the res-shield would come in handy to deflect explosions.

208,The Gun Volume Conversation,1564073489.0,7,"On this subreddit, you see this opinion posed a lot: ""They need to make the guns quieter! They're too loud and drawing attention so our squad gets third-partied all the time!"" While I agree that there are sound issues with the game - not being able to hear enemy footsteps, jumps, breakdance battles when they're right next to you, for instance - but I don't think the volume of weapon fire is an issue that needs to be corrected. The whole point of battle royale style games is to get a large number of people to fight each other until that big number becomes a small one and someone eventually wins.

&amp;#x200B;

Something I've noticed (and posted about before) is that in ranked play, once you get to platinum, people start camping a lot more. This is a trend that has started to bleed into normal play as well and one that my squad doesn't care for. A HUGE part of the reason we loved the game when it came out was because it forced players to 1. learn the weapons 2. be calculating in their movements and 3. end battles quickly so as not to draw too much attention/give your squad time to loot. Very often, we will find ourselves fighting 2 or 3 teams back-to-back simply because we're making too much damn noise, but that's a big part of what makes the game fun. Sneaking up and third-partying a team that just finished fighting can get you better loot (and is a big reason why people do it), but winning a 5 minute fight that just won't stop and leaving the location with 4 kills each is WAY more satisfying. The noise factor is just something you have to be conscious of when fighting. A very regular phrase among our squad is ""this fight is taking too long, one of us needs to watch for a third-party squad."" The noise-attraction is frustrating when you're on the losing end, but is something that will happen with any battle-royale game.",1

I've noticed there are multiple Sydney servers, Sydney 1, Sydney GCE 1 and so on, does it really matter which of the Sydney's are selected, or will they all intermix anyway.

Just wondering if anyone is experiencing the same sort of wait times or there's something going on. All our NAT's are open and seem to be working fine. I did read a few hints at cross play coming one day, hopefully that comes to fruition sooner rather than later.",1

If you think that you can play Ranked without communication; guess what? you will be stuck forever wherever you are.

I'm currently on Platinum 2 and since not all friends are online all the time I join a lot of solos and oh boy it's the worst experience you can ever get.

1. If someones pings enemies and you don't want to engage say something like ""wait guys I don't have good loot"" or ""there's another team coming there; let's wait for them"" or else we will end up watching you in a bush for 15minutes because we died since you didn't even try to shoot.
2. Once you have decent loot, **STICK TOGETHER;** stop running on your own and wherever you're going, ping it.
3. If someones pings enemies and you want to engage, don't start shooting from 400m away with your wingman/r301/r99 - you will be 3rd partied in no time - get closer.  If you have a sniper, tell your teammates; they might not have so you will need to cater for a different approach when engaging.
4. If you want to say something like ""wraith use ult so we can escape"" - are you seriously writing it when you have enemies shooting at you?  get a bloody microphone; it's fucking 2019 - with the gaming chair you bought you could have got a normal chair and 20,000 microphones and announce it worldwide

That is pretty inaccurate, since the majority of my games were played before Season 1 and a little bit into Season 1 as well. I've definitely respawned people before Season 2 and definitely assisted before Season 2 as well.

Me being a big support-type player, I am constantly respawning and reviving my teammates, so that number should be much higher. I also like to let my teammates get the kills so my assists should be much higher too 😅

They could do it on the current map or make a new map for it, but have more people in a match (100?). They also could make new abilities for it - so you could make your own loadout (passive ability, tactical, ultimate), they could even make the abilities unlockable when you hit certain levels, maybe just make them not as powerful as the current legend abilities. Or they could have different “legend kits” around the map, when you pick one up, you get all of certain legend’s abilities or maybe just one of their abilities - the kits could even be rarity based, for ones that are clearly better than others. I think the loadout thing would be cool though, kinda like COD and the perk system. Anyone have anything to add or change?

The gameplay is different for obvious reasons. sometimes you end up with a squad who likes to camp out a little, but i think it balances itself out a little bit since the storm is stronger. The game isnt perfect and theres still some big issues, imo the biggest issue is still the server issues. It got a little better recently but i still get booted a lot trying to connect to a game.

Thinking rationally though I had prettt slim chances of winning if I went around looking for fights. With that in mind I made sure inwas inside the ring and hid in a corner. As it turns out TWO carepacagese, not one but two carepacages land right infront of me and I was able to secure a mastiff and a L-star while the remainging squads fight it out.

336,My feedback for Ranked so far,1564059665.0,2,"Kills and Placement RP either needs to change or new RP methods need to be introduced, dealing 99% of the damage then having one stray bullet come and get a knock is frustrating and yes ""you might get one later"" but why am I then trusting in chance in a supposedly skill based game? Makes no sense.

&amp;#x200B;

The flip side of that is the camping meta, you are statistically more likely to get good RP for a game by just... doing nothing, which leads to a huge amount of people hitting high gold/plat by just abusing how easy it is to hide and run, not saying hiding and running should be harder but the points for doing so shouldn't be a guaranteed way to get to higher ranks like plat (not saying this is high elo but it shouldn't be so easy to hit).

&amp;#x200B;

Off the back of that why am I in my plat 4/3 games seeing diamond 3/2 complete squads and in that same game seeing silver 2/3s? There is such a wide spectrum of players surely the diamonds in that game are statistically way more likely to win due to their implied higher skill? It's really confusing when you see stuff like this in game how balancing works.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me earn RP for doing teamwork with my squad, if they get knocked and I revive them... give me literally anything for it and I'll be fine with it, same for assists and respawns, yes I know they need to then calculate for self damage and suicides but that's not hard to do at all it's probably already there in the background.

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty much all I have right now but, I'm sure I'll think of more in about a day or so that I forgot.",1

342,Ranked Queues are being cheated,1564066913.0,21,"So yesterday I used LFG to find a team, joined a team looking for a plat guy. When I joined one guy was Plat and the other Diamond. The diamond player leaves the lobby and tells his buddy to let him know when to join. I’m like wait what’s going on? The guy goes we’re doing the ranked queue bug.. I had no idea what he was talking about so I obviously asked him to explain. 

Basically the way it works is you get two people in the same lower division (plat in our case) and one guy who’s in a higher division trying to rank up easier. The two lower division guys will ready up as a duo in the lobby and once it says matchmaking the third joins the lobby and quickly readies up. If done correctly it will now put the diamond player in a plat queue. This can also be done with getting two silver, or even bronze guys tbh. In theory a diamond player can play in bronze and silver games all the way to Apex predator...

382,Rank Mode Points,1564060621.0,10,"Let me start off by saying I love Apex. It's been the first, first person shooter I have stayed committed to since the original Halo trilogy. This is mainly due to teammate work this game brings. I love multiplayer games where you must work as a team to come out on top, and other shooters like CoD and Overwatch just didn't deliver on that front for me at least. 

https://i.redd.it/0xnp0lqn9gc31.jpg

I've been playing Apex since release and instantly was hooked, I played throughout season 1 as well and reached rank 110 on Wild Frontier and currently level 51 in season 2. I think Respawn did a wonderful job on the new Ranked mode and how it operates. I think their scope on having people focus on teamwork over overall kills was wonderful. However, the ranked mode isn't quite perfected... aside from server issues, and the fact that RP forgiveness has never even worked nor do I think people are getting penalized at all for quitting, the only other issue that people seem to really have is the camping till late game.

Don't get me wrong I will be the first to admit I take full advantage of this when I'm solo or on a team of two, we do what we gotta to do to get those rank points. Though I never feel good about myself when I do it, nor do I judge anyone else to does the same. So how can Respawn fix this issue? 

Sorry in advanced if this has already been discussed here, if it has I haven't ran into the topic. I did make a comment on another post about this and got some feedback from other users already, and it made me want to make this post. I'll post the link here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/chkk7e/ranked\_mode\_in\_a\_nutshell/euv3asl/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/chkk7e/ranked_mode_in_a_nutshell/euv3asl/?context=3) 

I feel as though Ranked mode should also reward revives and respawns. They can make respawning teammates 1 point for each teammate. And also maybe make reviving 1 point with a max cap (Like Kills) at like 3. This would encourage people to camp less and take riskier plays and still fit Respawns scope of team play over kills. 

I would love to hear other peoples thoughts on this. Would you camp less if you were rewarded on more altruistic plays?",1

I love the game and it's fast pace. BUT I HATE how the currently people are afking in buildings and hiding in corners of the map to gain points......   
I don't mind if the enemy does it but when my random squad decides to stay afk and just move if the ring gets close there is no point playing as I might as well have a screen saver on.   


The game should reward you for fighting people rather than playing hide and seek. Being matched up with Caustic and Wattson that just want to  stay in one building and don't use comms is enraging.  
(In general people that do not use comms or even the ping system should not be allowed to play ranked imo)

It's not fun to camp and it ruins the flow of the game.  


Please rework the points system to force players to stay on the move rather that sit in one spot....  


I am sorry for the rant but after spending an entire day of trying to rank up being matched with low skill players is incredibly frustrating when they sit in one spot and do nothing.

The last couple of days I've encountered this  issue (?). I usually don't play with friends as I only get to play a couple of matches a day, so I always play with randoms.

On Ranked I just passed from Silver I to Gold IV and I've been paired with other Gold teammates that are on party with Bronze IV players, being those Bronze players not so familiar with the game or just running around the map, and after losing those matches because the Bronze player died and quit and the Gold player throwing the match due to being on party with the Bronze dude, it hit me...

Ranked players parties should be locked, something like Overwatch does in Competitive and SR and being something like this:

Bronze: Can only play with Bronze, Low Silver (IVs).
Silver: Can play with Silver, Gold.
Gold: Can play with Silver, Gold and Low Platinum.
Platinum: Can play with Platinums and Diamonds.
Diamonds: Can play with Platinums, Diamonds and Apex Predator.
Apex Predator: Can play with Diamond and Apex Predator.

Just because I grind my way solo on Ranked I shouldn't pay the cost of having teammates in lower ranks throwing the game because the cost to enter the match is lower than mine and they don't suffer because of it whilst I'm left stranded on 1vAll due to my team leaving.

445,Legend Tokens &amp; Other Frustrations,1564078997.0,3,"I really do love this game. I play it almost every night with my friends. However, there are a couple of things that still really bother me about this game. First off, I have maxed out on levels of my account. This means that every time I ""level up"" (which has been about every 3-5 games) I get a reward of like 120 legend tokens. This does not help me when you have already unlocked all the available legends in the game. I now have over 38,000 legend tokens and can't do s\*\*t with them. Give us something we can do with them! Allow us to trade them in for crafting materials or SOMETHING!

Also, if there was one other thing I'd love to see slightly changed about the game it would be the barrel stabilizers. I think it would be cool if they acted more like silencers on top of reducing recoil. In my theory, level 1 barrel stabilizers only reduce recoil a small amount but every level you go up your gun gets slightly quieter and recoil is reduced more each time like it already is. A gold barrel stabilizer would make your gun ""silenced"" like a gun in Call of Duty for example and obviously provide the same level recoil reduction that it already does.

Lastly, can we PLEASE get a digital threat type sight for assault rifles and light machine guns. If we're being honest I just would just like to see some sort of level 4 (gold) attachment for every slot of every gun and have them all bring something to the table like gold body armor, helmets, backpacks, knockdown shields do.

If you look carefully when you are healing up, you can see that her fingers on her left arm are prosthetic. This leads me to an interesting thought. 

Also, on the left side of her face, there is the lichen scar from something to do with electricity. I am thinking, Wattson was involved in an accident where her left arm could not be used any more. They had to cut it off or it fell off. Somebody, most probable is her father, made a bionic arm for Wattson. 

Other parts of her body could also be involved in the accident but we don’t know because she is wearing clothes. Her clothes could be covering other bionic parts. So Wattson could be a cyborg. She is probably insulated very well so she is not hurt by her fences and her pylon. Another thing that strengthens this theory is her legendary robotic skins. Here is a image. Look at her white prosthetic fingers—

https://imgur.com/gallery/eqmkl43

We don’t need to consider other Wattson’s fences because there are not 2 Wattson’s in the legends universe. It’s just in the game where there might be more than 1 Wattson. I’m talking about story line here. Not the gameplay stuff. 

This leads me to believe that the creator of Pathfinder is Wattson’s dad. If he made parts for Wattson, it is a possibility that he made Pathfinder. Also Pathfinder can access the beacons and I believe that Wattson’s dad placed the beacons for Pathfinder to use. 

Maybe he was hoping if Pathfinder accesses the beacon in a certain order, it would tell him his creator was Wattson’s dad. It might say it in binary or something so Pathfinder can read it but most people can’t read it. 

Or Pathfinder was made by Mirage or someone in Mirage’s family. Why you say? The reason why  is because Mirage, and Pathfinder both have a legendary skin with the name Angel City in it. Maybe that was where Mirage was born. 

Also Mirage has lines about Pathfinder when you are in the legends picking screen. It is something like, “I hope I’m not with that happy robot. I’m joking, I’m joking, I love everybody). Or the other reason they both have Angel City in there skins is probably because they met at bar and were friends or whatever.

Below are some ideas on how to implement this system.

1: when you dc, you either a) pause in position and until you reconnect. Or b) you drop a crate (like currently) but your teammates can grab your banner and revive you once you reconnect. 

2: you only get the points if you rejoin the game. If the game is finished and you are not in the game, you don’t get the points from after you disconnected. 



Extra thought:  not a tech wiz, but surely there should be a way to detect a genuine loss of internet connection and you still gain point for your squads win, given you were actually contributing and not getting carried (eg. you dc before the 1st ring and let your mate carry you to a win) 

I’d love to hear your thoughts on this, it was a really good system in csgo, but I understand how much more difficult it would be to implement something like that into a battle Royal game.",1

490,My solution to third parties and quitters,1564091181.0,6,"**My solutions to third parties:**

HP on squad wipe. Not when you kill someone, as it promotes finishing, but when you wipe the squad. When you wipe a squad it could:

1. Restore everyone's health (not shield) to 100.
2. 50 HP or Shield to everyone.
3. Give everyone HP or shields based on the amount of damage they did to the enemy squad.

**OR**

All downed team mates are auto revived. Similar to when your team is town and you win the game, everyone pops back up and heals before the third party comes in.

**My solution to quitters:**

**Casual:** No XP, stats, or challenge progress if you quit.

**Ranked:** Same as casual, but you get a timeout *every* time you quit, and the ban gets higher each time. Up to week long or permanent bans.

""But what if you disconnect?"" How often does this honestly happen? If your internet is bad enough where you are constantly lagging out, it's not fair to your team to be a playing a team based game. Especially in ranked.",1

Right now, the placements are too clunky.",1564053246.0,12,"I mean when you place down Wattson’s Tactical, you have to activate it with your Tactical button and then use your fire button to place down the traps. Then you press the Tactical button to close end the Tactical placement stuff. I think that is too clunky. 

Other legends Tac is just press the button and it throws the Tac out or uses it up. 

But with Wattson, it is much more clunky. I propose, you just press the Tactical button to place down a pole. The pole would have a blueish whiteish ring around it so you know that you can place another trap inside the ring so they connect. 

I also thought, the fences could have a quick place where you just tap the Tactical button to drop down a fence. The quick place could be used in the middle of fights. Also there could be a more “in-depth” placement where you can hold the Tactical button to get the placement we have now. So when you are building a base, you can use the more “in-depth” placement. This could also be used for the Ult. 

Also, Wattson’s ult placement is super clunky. I played Octane a lot and I’ve been killed so many times I can’t count because I forgot you have to press the Ultimate button and then the fire button. It should be where you press the button and it just tosses out the Ult. 

If it can’t be placed, the ult won’t be placed and a there would be a sound telling you it can’t be placed there. The current version is killing me too many times when I forget that I have to press the fire button after pressing the Ult button. It should be like Octanes jump pad where it is just thrown out with the press of a button. 

Apex devs, please read this and consider changing her placements to something like this. I think many of you have been killed countless times when you pressed the Ult button but forgot to press the place button after you pressed the Ult button.

There could be a toggle in the menu for people who like it the original way and people like me who want a new way.

585,What if APEX is a Lie?,1564071324.0,15,"TL;DR: what if the loot in apex is like Mario Kart items?

Maybe I am paranoid but I am starting to think the loot in the supply bins in APEX Legends is fake.

Does the loot in the supply bin exist before you open it?  Like when the match starts, is every supply bin full of loot or is it populated with loot when you open it?

My theory is that the supply bins are like boxes in Mario Kart.  The loot is “randomly” assigned when you open it.

I put “randomly” assigned in quotes because I don’t think it is completely random.

I have started to think that APEX sometimes deals you a hot hand on purpose to keep you playing.  It’s no secret that it would be easy to code the boxes to provide advantageous loot given your current load out.

Much like how you’re more likely to get a blue shell if you’re in last place when playing mario kart than the banana. 

I don’t think APEX is trying to slow down winners or speed up winners within the current round, but I do think they are trying to make it so every player is the APEX Champ within X number of games to keep them interested.

If you know about operant conditioning - you know that a “random” reward schedule is best for training behavior. However, pure randomization (rolling dice) is not better than aided randomization (Mario Kart Boxes and maybe APEX Supply Bins).

What do you think?",1
586,Disrespect the Caterpillar rave about the Butterfly,1564002081.0,11,"I see alot of disgruntled Redditors bashing Respawn and especially Apex like some kinda of trash Br. I been with Apex from the start and I adore this game from the Peacekeeper meta , Wingman meta , and the Disruptor meta I've love it all.  I never really been with a game from day 1. I watched it grow and evolve from the beginning and i know over time this game is gonna get even more popular. I'm excited for Apex and Respawn to grow as a company even more and have more opportunities like the new Star Wars and other projects. This company creates interesting games and each department is very Creative 👌  they take their time and communicate with the community. I never played Titanfall but is planning to and , I'm willing to bet on Respawn and more specifically Apex that it's gonna grow even more and they'll be able do everything for Apex like they want to. All it takes is *Patience* and I know the Devs are Listening, reading and reacting to the community.



Long story short this game is an *Awesome* take on Battle Royal and I'm very optimistic about the direction it's heading. Filled with great lore, unique legends, Balanced gameplay, innovative systems, and Developers that listen to their community, Thanks Respawn for everything

First of all I should say that I had a **clean Origin installation** when doing this and followed the steps on this website to clear Origin cache :  [https://help.ea.com/en-us/help/faq/clear-cache-to-fix-problems-with-your-games/](https://help.ea.com/en-us/help/faq/clear-cache-to-fix-problems-with-your-games/)

(but you **might not need to do this yourselves** , mind that I had reinstalled Origin a few times until I came up with this solution on a Sims 4  forum discussion ).

&amp;#x200B;

So , to the solution itself :

&amp;#x200B;

1. Go here  [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026213/windows-how-to-set-your-time-and-time-zone](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026213/windows-how-to-set-your-time-and-time-zone) .
2. Click on the **Open Date &amp; time settings** button .
3. Set both the **-Set time automatically** and **-Set time zone automatically** to ON .
4. Wait a little while and test if you can now login back to Origin , for me I still couldn't .
5. On the same **Date &amp; time settings** you were before scroll down and click on **Add clocks for different time zones** .
6. On the window that pops up switch to the **Internet Time** tab and click on the **Change Settings** button .
7. If **Synchronize with an internet time serve**r isn't ticked , tick it , for me [time.nist.gov](https://time.nist.gov) made my Origin work while [time.windows.com](https://time.windows.com) didn't , so if you had the latter simply switch it to the first and vise versa on the drop down menu and click **Update Now .**
8. Click on **OK** , **Apply** and test Origin connection , if it still doesn't work restart your Computer and test again .

**ich have two ideas for ranked mode:**

&amp;#x200B;

**1) Chance the points for kills system. Its a team game so squad kills should count for everybody in the team. With a 0,5RP per kill, to a maximum off 15 kills, so your squad kann get 7,5RP per member, and everybody gets it.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**2) Chance the points for placing ranks. If your squad gets 3 squad kills or more in the game you get the full points  as until now. If your squad gets less than 3 squad kills in the game you get half the points for your placing, so (Top10 -&gt; 1RP / Top5 -&gt; 2RP / Top3 -&gt; 3,5RP / Champion -&gt; 6RP).**

611,Apex Legends Ranked League Improvement Ideas,1564044583.0,8," 

So I have been grinding Apex Ranked Leagues and am currently in the Platinum League where things really change and me and my friend were discussing a few ideas for improvements.

Bear in mind I play some solo but usually with one guy and sometimes 2 guys ones in Gold and the other still bronze (Doesnt play enough), this is mainly due to how much I play in comparison to them and is partly where some of these ideas come from.

So regardless of their rank as you know this means we all play in Platinum League, so here are some ideas. What do you guys think and what ideas do you have?

1. Improved points when playing out of your league - As I say we are all now playing in Platinum but i left my mates behind so even though they are in lower leagues themselves its taking them far too long to catch up. I think double points when playing out of your league could work. I dont think boosting would do anyone any good anyway but could be a potential arguement against this idea?
2. Its a little too campy right now - Placement is key to progress and not losing points but this just makes everyone hide and leave team mates behind for more points so prevent loss. Perhaps raise the kill cap points in higher leagues or perhaps grant points for more of you team mate making the higher placement together as opposed to one of you making it? or maybe kills prior to top 10/5 count for 2 points, ideas welcome.
3. Downs vs kills - I feel the biggest issue right now is thirsting the kill because downs don't get you that point and we all know the correct way to place is move on to the next guy and not thirst the kill but the point system ruins this when playing with randoms. Why not get the points for the down instead and perhaps that last squad wipe kill gets 2 points - Again ideas welcome. With a kill/down cap anway I don't see this being abused?
4. Betting point system - This ones just for more fun and ways to play. Perhaps in addition to challenges you could bet points on them, so put down a point if you do it get 2 back if not you lose the point? Maybe specific new challenges to suit this sytem more. Use certain weapon of charcter for kill/downs being most likely?
5. Win Badges - Rather than Div 2 wins why not Gold League Wins, Plat League Wins etc this means players like my friends although only showing as Gold rank can show they have won games in Platinum.

Just food for thought people what do we think?",1

622,What Apex Legends really needs!,1564010595.0,3,"This post is mainly addressed to the developers.

So here it goes:

**1. Code Leaf/Code Net:** I can't play 2 matches in a row without Code Leaf. With the launch of season 2 Code Leaf just became more frequent and it affects **≈** 60 people every time. This has to be fixed soon because it will hurt in the long run.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. I am not sure this is a launcher bug or a game bug:** Sometimes when somebody from my friendslist quits a game or comes back online AND I'm playing Apex, the game just goes to the tray. The problem is that it takes 2-3 seconds for the game to come back on the screen so I can't do anything for 3 seconds which got me killed a few times.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. When launching/relaunching Apex sometimes the menu takes AGES to load:** The thing is that I tend to crash when code leaf happens and when I relaunch the menu, the loading time can take up to 1-2 minutes. And it happens for no particular reason because I have a fairly new and powerful computer.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Still can't use any resolution:** I play most FPS games in 16:10 aspect ratio and in 1920\*1200 resolution on a 4k monitor (this is important) and its native ratio is 16:9. So I use 1920\*1080 (fullhd) resolution for my desktop and because of this I can't change the ingame resolution to 1920\*1200 it just doesn't let me do that.

https://i.redd.it/43iowj854cc31.png

 Now look this game (below) is from **2007** and I can change my resolution to whatever I want. 

https://i.redd.it/kqglis884cc31.png

Now there is a solution but this is still bad none the less. Remember that i have a 4k monitor.... Apparently if you increase your native (desktop) resolution for example to 4k, you can choose 1920\*1200 but you need a monitor bigger than fullhd so if you don't have a bigger one then you will never be able to play in 16:10 fullhd. You can also change back your native resolution and the game ""will remember"" that you set your resolution to XYZ. **But there is more...**

**5. The game frequently fails to launch in fullscreen:** And because of this sometimes the game fucks up my resolution if I put the game in fullscreen with ALT+ENTER.

648,Lets talk about the training mode.,1563965721.0,20,"Hey guys!  


Apex Legends is one of my favorite games right now. I am so thrilled that the developers really seem to listen to the community and are open to suggestions about changes to the game. I think it takes a lot of courage, open mindedness and professionalism to have the players give feedback, and then following up by changing your game. I am truly thankful for that and I am sure lots of other people are too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's cut to the chase. I want to talk about the training mode that Apex Legends offers. I think it's great to have a mode where you can train your aiming skills and feel with all the guns. I'm an average player, if not below average, so I try to spend about 15 minutes at least before every gaming session shooting at the targets to get my muscle memory to a point where I feel more comfortable playing the game. I value the training mode a lot and I think in it's current state there is a lot to be improved upon. Now that the game has a more solid basis in core gameplay and level progression, I want to start a discussion about what the training mode does right, but mostly where it could see some improvements, because I think it's time for the training ground to get overhauled. So let's jump right in:

&amp;#x200B;

**PROS:**

* *Simplicity.*
   * The main purpose of the training ground speaks to itself: Shoot the targets to improve your aim and get to know all the guns*.* This is the main goal of the area and the design supports it well.
* *Mobility.*
   * There's a lot of room for testing out your mobility and you'll get rewarded for finding places that are tough to get to by putting little easter eggs there. Apart from that the player can also find different places to shoot the targets from, which can be reached from most places.
* *New player experience.*
   * For people who never played the game, or any like it for that matter, the training area shows the absolute basics you need to know in order to understand how to play the game and what it will offer.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONS:**

* *Targets.*
   * As of right now there are only two type of targets: Human silhouette targets and Box targets. All silhouette targets are all stationary and flip over immediately on impact. When shot they register a standard hit, with the head registering as a headshot. Box targets are really large and turn red when shot registering as standard hits. Some of the box targets are moving, but they move slower than a character who's walking with a weapon, and slightly faster than a crouched character. But this adds only a small challenge, since the targets are so big. Both the targets have designs that suggest a certain point system, but these are only aesthetics.
* *Tutorial.*
   * In order to get to the shooting part of the area, i.e. the main focus of everyone who has done the tutorial before, you need to go through the tutorial of the basics of the game. Apart from that, you have to wait for certain objectives to appear after Bloodhound explains them, so you can't rush through all objectives before getting to the shooting part.
* *Attachments.*
   * Currently the training area offers (basically) no attachments. From a training standpoint I understand this choice, as you need to get comfortable with the vanilla version of every gun, before trying to deck it out completely. But some attachments, predominately hop-ups, can change weapons to such an extent that it's worth it to add them to the training grounds.
* *Feedback.*
   * The only sense feedback you're getting right now is the hitmarkers. There's no hard data showing how well you're doing or how you're improving. As said before, the hitboxes on the targets are dull and large and even though their design suggests it, there's no way to see if you hit the box target bulls-eye, or the outside ring.

&amp;#x200B;

**INDECISIVE:**

* *Lifeline only.*
   * Mostly I like that you can only play as lifeline, because it puts the focus more on the actual shooting and mobility mechanics. But I on the other hand, every character feels different in their playstyle. The reason I'm indecisive about this is because other than Pathfinders' grapple, there is no ability I would otherwise need to practice.
* *Landing training.*
   * Landing is a vital part of the game and if done incorrectly, it can be the difference between getting looted early, or getting killed. However, you only have to properly land once every game and it's very easy do do correctly after a few games.
* *ALL Attachments.*
   * Although I mentioned the importance of using vanilla guns before adding attachments, I still think there is an argument to be made that all attachments of all levels should be added to the training area. I think its good to be able to calmly try out what certain attachments do and how they affect your gun, just to get a sense of what attachments you want to prioritize.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I lined up these thoughts about what I think of the training grounds, I want to look at what changes could be made to improve the training grounds, without losing too much simplicity:

* *Target variation:*
   * Make some boxes smaller.
   * Have some human targets not flip over when hit.
   * Make targets move faster, slower and have some more unproductively
   * Add different targets, like a 'clay pidgeon' that shoots disks at different velocities and angles every time.
* *Tutorial:*
   * Have the player follow the tutorial by default on first time entering the training grounds. After that initial training, the player can talk to Bloodhound when entering the training grounds to start the tutorial again.
* *Feedback and Challenges:*
   * Let some box targets show an accuracy hitmarker, instead of the default damage hitmarker. The closer you are to the little diamond in the middle, the higher you'll score. I'm saying some box targets, because it's also interesting to see how much damage a full clip would do to a character.
   * Add information boards with feedback on how you're doing with certain guns this session. These stats could also show an average of how you do on average in training grounds and during normal games. Stats like this invite the player to challenge themselves to keep getting better scores every time they enter the area.
   * Add mobility and obstacle paths with feedback boards showing your running time and course records.
   * (Add a skydive option with landing targets at varying distances, showing how long you took every time)
* *Attachments:*
   * Add attachments to the training grounds.
   * To encourage vanilla training maybe have the attachments unlock after getting a certain amount of points with the vanilla gun.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure there's a lot more improvements to be had in the training grounds, even I have more ideas on how to improve the game mode, but I think this post is long enough as it is. So if you have any more ideas, let the community know in the comments! Maybe with the next update we'll see some great improvements that the mode deserves.",1

680,Which Throwable Is The Best?,1563999595.0,7,"I came across a comment today mentioning arc star being the best throwable in the game, and how we should prioritize that instead of the other ones in our inventory.

I personally used to think the same until I ran out of arc starts one game and looted a death box and all they had was thermites.

Let me just say that I cannot stick an arc star unless you’re standing still looting or whatever. So when I threw that thermite in the general direction of the enemy team I was able to easily knock one down. After that all I pick up(if I have the space) is thermites.

So if you can’t land your arc stars, then I suggest you start picking up the “death by fire” ones.",1
681,[Theory] Pathfinder's Purpose,1563992582.0,3,"Hi there, r/apexlegends!

Recently, a friend of mine came up with a somewhat hilarious explanation for Pathfinder's existence. We were just playing the game, and during one of our drops he quipped as follows:

""What if Pathfinder is just a cameraman-robot?"", he said, and we all laughed. But then we got to thinking - it makes perfect sense! So he continued by running a list of features that would be excellent for our beloved broadcasting automaton to have.

&amp;#x200B;

* Pathfinder is a MRVN, which is a type of robot designed to scout and survey locations. This explains his mobility, but it doesn't explain his ability to interact with the survey beacons specifically set up in King's Canyon. The ability in-game is called ""Insider Knowledge"", implying a direct connection with the Apex Games. Using this ability, he could always stay safe from the ring, and easily predict where skirmishes would take place and where squads would face their final moments in a match.
* His ability to create ziplines and quickly maneuver around the map assists him in rapidly changing the camera angle when necessary. He could provide exciting, human POV perspectives when sliding down hills or watching gunfights, unlike flying drones and stationary cameras - he could even participate in the initial drop! Perhaps his human silhouette was often confused for a competitor during test runs, which is why they ended up not using him in the games.
* His creator is presumably the same person who designed the arena itself. Wattson's father Luc was the lead electrical engineer, and while Wattson herself designed the ring, it's never said who integrated the survey beacons with the system, or who designed the rest of the arena. Based on the fact that they have no dialogue between them, we can assume that Wattson and Pathfinder have nothing to do with eachother - but perhaps he had something to do with Luc, or another engineer.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing that remains unexplained is Pathfinder's ability to shoot guns proficiently. He must have been built with this ability in mind, since his hands are the right size to operate the guns, his joints can handle the recoil, etc. The only idea I have for this is that his model is just built like this in general, and that it was chosen as a good fit for a combat arena. Besides that, though, CameraMRVN is my new headcanon.",1
682,my hot-take on where this game is currently standing,1564003363.0,10,"I love this game, but I feel it will struggle to grow without fixing ranked mode (change the boring campy meta and force gunfights), adding solo and/or duo queue (but it’s not a solo game, yeah well tell that to the countless solos who now dip off from the group so they can hide and get a precious top 5 on their own), adding a new map (which is what this game is going to need to do it won’t work how fortnite does it this map is already growing stale) and balancing/fixing guns, buffing weapon/armour loot drops (worst out of any BR i’ve ever played) and sorting server latency/disconnects/packet loss.

Problem is they have too small of a team to combat all of this within the next 70 days for the next season, this game won’t die it’s mechanics are too good in itself but like PUBG it will develop its own hardcore community with returning players infrequently coming back.",1

 1) Kill 2 enemies with care package weapons on the same match. Impossible for me, I could have done it when the L-Star was just released and there were two care packages at the start of every round. With my skill level, is difficult enough to get to a care package, let alone kill (not only knock down) two enemies on the same match. Also nearly impossible for me are missions like ""get two headshots with sniper rifles on the same match""; if I get them it's mostly luck so I usually give up on completing it. 

 2) Open two care packages. This one I could complete, though so far today my teammates have opened the care packages first, not minding me when I told them that I just wanted to open them for a mission and they could get all that was inside. Also, I have a weekly mission that's open two care packages on the same match, I don't know how I'll ever do it since it's difficult to be near and open one, let alone two.

I'll often be running away from the incoming storm (in most cases this happens with the round one storm closing), pinging ahead of me repeatedly in hopes teammates will follow. Yet, a lot of times they'll keep taking their sweet old time looting and screwing around. Sometimes I think that they're just unaware that the storm is about to come and swallow them despite the announcer's warnings and the occasional character voice line. I think it'd be handy to have a ping option that effectively warns ""hey you slow ass mfs, the storm is comin' and we gotta gtfo."" This would be even more useful in ranked mode and later-round storm closings. What do you guys think?

edit: Wanted to clarify what I had in mind. I'm thinking of a ping like ""attacking here"" or ""looting here"" so that you could ping a destination and it'd pop up with an icon and your character could say something like ""Friends, the ring is coming and we should run!""

The other person, will land on your ass. He will not break off, and even when the game breaks you off 1 sec before touchdown, he will be causing confusion  by opening a door, which you then close, which he then opens again.

That’s when you hear ‘Shot’s fired, and they’re hitting me.’ From skulltown. You run across the map to help them, but if they are killed, they will leave. Some will stay until you are 2 m away from a beacon and then leave.

Now, you have your caustic at bunker, still looting, you are at skull town, the circle is Hydro Dam.

You get a few kills on your way to the Dam, while the caustic is STILL LOOTING, outside the RING. He is knocked down, then dead and then spams the Ping My Banner, when there are 3 squads left.

771,Wattson’s hitbox is pretty small height wise. I haven’t figured out a good way to measure width. I’m just eyeing it. I use all the small characters and use the characters that were in Wattson’s squad in the Season 2 trailer!,1563997108.0,1,"Sorry for formatting. I am on mobile right now. 

This is a long post so there is a TL;DR at the end.

So I am just going to post the link to the pictures I have posted on imgur. The lines on the images are where there is a line on the banner in the background. The characters I chose were the small hitbox ones and the ones on Wattson’s team in the Season 2 trailer. 

https://imgur.com/gallery/bn07DVq

Wraith is the character with the smallest hitbox. As you can see, her head (not including the bun. That is not in the hitbox) is significantly lower than the line. She is very small. Her body width is small. Also, in game, she Naruto runs. Which makes her harder to hit. Wraith’s legs are skinny as fuck. So a bit harder to hit in the leg area. Don’t know why anyone would aim for the legs... Head is normal sized.

Now looking at Wattson, her head is just a little bit lower than the line. So she is pretty small height wise, I am guessing that her hitbox is also her jacket so her body width is a bit bigger than Wraith and Lifeline. She runs regularly. Unlike Wraith who Naruto runs. Wattson’s legs are kinda thicc so her legs are easier to hit. Head is normal sized. 

We look at Octane next and we can tell his head is higher than the line which means his hitbox height is larger than Wraith, Lifeline, and Wattson. His body width is like an athletic persons so it is normal. Legs are skinny too because they are prosthetics. His head is normal sized. He is kind of hard to hit when he uses his stim or his jump pad. Everyone is hard to hit when they are using the jump pad. Well maybe with the exception of Gibby it Caustic. 

Moving on too, Lifeline, we can see in her default relaxing animation, she is leaning to the right a bit. So if we made her stand straight, I am assuming that her head (not including buns) will touch the line. Her body is normal sized. Her legs are thiccish. Her head is relatively small though. She also runs weird. 

And now on to Bangalore. She probably has the biggest hitbox height in all the legends I’m comparing. Her hair counts as part of her hitbox which I think is a bit crazy. Her body width is pretty normal. Her legs are fine and her head is basically normal. 

TL;DR — All in all, Wattson has a great hitbox size. Pretty small. I think her design was great. I feel the reason her fences are kind of weak is because of her hitbox. Like Caustic has a huge hitbox but his passive has more power than Wattson’s. I think the devs balanced them out like this. 

If I were to order their hitboxes from smallest to biggest, I would have them as such— 
Wraith, Wattson or Lifeline, Octane, and then Bangalore.

This is just my 2 cents.",1

774,Ranked point reward overhaul,1564018193.0,5,"I feel like you guys could have easily put more thought into the points system of ranked play. It inordinately rewards campers, and not the supports of the game.

Here are my suggestions:

Top 10: +1 points

Top 5: +2 points

Third: +4 points

Second: +6 points

First: +8 points

Kills are worth +1 point until 3, then diminishing to every 2 kills reward a point (so 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.)

Assists are worth +1 point every 2 assists, to a max of +3 points.

Each kill the damage role gets with, or supported with, their ults gets +1 point, with the same diminishing returns as for normal kills. (Supported with would be someone (including you) getting a kill within 10 seconds of you damaging with/using your ult.)

This counts with the support role as well, with the diminishing returns. (any kills gotten within 30 seconds of that person using your ult gets you +1)

The tank role would be the same as damage.

Damage is worth 1 point every 500 damage you deal.

This would stop rewarding camping as much, and reward smart ult usage, and also rewards long, drawn out fights where hundreds or even 1000+ damage is thrown out. There is no cap to the rewards on kills, so there would be little value in 2+ teams drawing out a fight longer than necessary. This obviously may need a little rebalancing, or even just force Respawn to add an extra tier/more required points within a tier, but I think this would feel a lot more rewarding to us as players.

TL;DR
The points system for ranked is flawed, I proposed adding points for damage, as well as for assisting in multiple facets. The goal is a more rewarding-feeling ranked experience.",1

789,"""Chronic Rage Quitter"" queue, similar to LoL's low priority queue",1563989012.0,10,"Picture this (really shouldn't be that hard, probably happened to you 2-3 games ago):

You lock in your first choice, feeling good about the game. Everyone locks in and you're good to go. Game starts, countdown finishes, and boom before you know it, the jumpmaster is hotdropping. Straight down you go, you ping your building and go in, find nothing but a P2020 and a white helmet. And boom, both your party members are dead in another building to one person. You go through your building, killing their teammate and picking up his armor and a real gun. Down the wraith that entered your building and start the finisher, but she alt F4s so you don't even get to complete the daily mission. Around this time both party members have already rage quit and reached back into their Monster filled mini-fridge for the 4th time today, but you're looting the wraith and hear footsteps. It's the other 2 members of that party. You kill one, run and reload, then kill the other. You settle down for a moment and loot the 4 players you killed, and realize you're alone in the hotdrop. At least 1 squad, maybe two comes up to you, and you're in a 1v3+ situation and you die.

Why do I get punished for having the slightest bit of faith, or commitment to the game, when the people I get matched with are the ones causing issues?

&amp;#x200B;

Just some sort of ""Rage quit from 5 games a week makes you wait 5 mins before queue starts, 10 rage quits = 10 mins, and so on in intervals of 5"" system would do so much for stopping those annoying gremlins from leaving. Then again, maybe it's just me who sees this in 3/5 games I play, but I feel like this should be something that lots of people who actually want to play the game have issues with.

It hurts me so much, that some obvious faulty logic like this can be released to a big game like Apex.

How a team that places 10th with 0 kill be rewarded more total RP than a team placed 11th with 5 kills is beyond me, Ranked is supposed to place everyone at their ranking according to their overall skill level.

""Well bro, it´s a game of survival""is it? CS:GO is also about survival, Dota 2 is also about survival.. Minecraft is about survival, wait every game is about survival?

Now, did you ever care about comming 9th, or 11th before ranked? no you didnt, you didnt care if you came 7th or 5th either.. all that mattered was first place and kills.

The game currently is being played accordingly to the RP segments, Top 10/ Top 5, and Top 3..If there are lets say 12 squads left, it´s all about running, team mates ditching a battle or a clutch moment just to get to top 10 alone.. and while he is top 10.. why not go for top 5? so what ends up happening is 2-3 teams/players each game just go around camping solo to try to sneak in a top 2.

I myself have done it countless of times, all alone with 12 squads left.. i crouch around untill top 3.

This is not the apex i loved and enjoyed back in random pub games.

Ranked should have a fluid ""RP"" system,15-12 1RP ; 11-8 2RP ; 8-5 3RP ; 4-3 4RP ; 2 6RP ; 1 9RP

Kills should be rewarded more, because killing is ultimately what defines skill in FPS games.Kill cap is legit the most anti climatic thing i´ve seen in an FPS Game.

***Side note:*** I don´t like the ""Highest ranked lobby member"", kills all fun playing with lower skilled friends. I hate that we have to suffer just because some people will exploit it and ""boost"" to a rank which they don´t belong, i just played Underlords and they have adjusted team rankings.. i lose more rank if i place bad,  and my lower ranked team mate gets higher rank mmr if he places better.. sure there probably is a 5-10% who abuse this and ""boost"",but honestly who cares ? Not CS:GO/Overwatch/Underlords and all the other games i recall playing ranked on, the 90% who wants to play with friends on fair adjusted team ranks should be able to do so! If desperate kids want to create new accounts and level up just to boost, so be it.. thats not going to give me sleepless nights lol.",1

818,How to help prevent hackers/fixing ranked,1563998807.0,1,"So one of the biggest issues I've seen with ranked, well two biggest is there is NO level restriction. In itself doesn't seem harmful until you get into the nitty gritty of it all. Ranked is suppose to be a MORE competitive scene is it not? Then why is that you can be level 10 and jump right in? I can bet my emo pants from 2005 that not a damn soul after playing this game for 10 levels is ready to jump into ranked matches. This needs to be implemented like other games and require a much higher level cap. I understand you want everyone to feel welcomed and what not but it's ranked the whole point is that your suppose to work to get there and then work to climb the ladder once your there. This is just open to whoever willy nilly downloads the game which is probably one of the dumbest ideas I've seen so far in any competitive game and I've seen quite a few things.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing this would ALSO help with is hackers. It's obviously a free game (duh) so once (if) they do get banned they can quite literally be back into ranked within maybe 20-40 minutes from the time to create a new account to hitting level 10. Obviously a bit exaggerated but it doesn't take very long to hit level 10. It's close to the hourish mark I'd say give or take (with a hacker probably exactly or less than that.) Adding the level restriction makes it so they have to at least hit level X to join. This allows a lot more time to catch them and get them banned before they join into the ranked/competitive community of the game and ruin it and everyone quits as usual until it's fixed up a bit. It just works for both sides of the coin here not sure why it wasn't thought of from the very beginning.

&amp;#x200B;

I've posted this on the actual forums which was probably my fault since more people are active here and see things here. Now for the prime membership this I don't expect as much for multiple reasons but nonetheless here it goes. I'm sure most or quite a few of you guys know about CSGO (Counter-Strike Global Offensive) before they ruined what they had going for a bit they had a Prime membership that required a phone number (the game itself was already $15) this helped tone down the hackers albeit not very well since numbers are easy to get a hold of via apps. However using this model could probably charge a one time fee for a prime membership + add phone number &lt;---this part I know you guys are already working on but this part has easy work arounds so it isn't the most solid part but it does help. At least this way you guys can profit off the hackers if they choose to keep making new accounts. Obviously with ANY of this implemented there would have to also be massive ban waves either right before or after it goes into affect just to lower the overall number from the start and work from there. At the beginning you really have to hunt them down like dogs which will kinda ruin it for most of them because not many are going to keep dishing out that money.

&amp;#x200B;

This unfortunately leaves the problem of them still being all over the casual games and with level restrictions if you added those would be a problem for some new players. But since you guys are working on something to ban off red flags soon I figure it wouldn't be the worst case scenario considering the current situation.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Add level restrictions for ranked to prevent completely new players joining they should be practicing on casual more than 10 levels. Also stops hackers from creating new accounts and jumping into ranked almost immediately. Prime+phone number to further improve the hacking situation overall.",1

831,Rank System Flaw Question,1563983542.0,18,"First, I'm going to start off for saying thanks Respawn for implementing a ranking system to keep competition fair.

Second, I'm going to say I suck at this game.

&amp;#x200B;

The Issue:

With the current ranking system, bc points are awarded for how long you survive, low-level ranking for scrubs like me is inflated throughout the Bronze bracket.

I'm literally stuck on Silver IV, can't move down into the Bronze bracket where I belong, can't move up. I've been in Silver IV for five hours now and have 0 kills to my name.

At least in Bronze, I would get a kill per game, maybe. I felt like overtime I might get better. Now, I figure maybe it's time to just move on. I'm literally just playing hide and seek that I'll never win.

&amp;#x200B;

Respawn is your team happy with the current Rank model and what do you think about my issue/struggle?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Many comments have already talked about improving in Silver IV where I belong.

1. For me to improve in Silver IV, I probably should only be playing Silve IV players not Silver I players. I thought the ranking system was to help make the competition even. Nope, bottem feeders like me are just that but in Silver.
2. Playing in Silver is so outside my skill development, I doubt I'll improve. See Zone of Proximal Development - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone\_of\_proximal\_development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development)
3. I think I'm just going to move on and keep an eye out for a better ranking system, whether it's in season 3 or 4 or a different game. I just started a redownload of Overwatch, and Anthem (yeah I said Anthem) seems like a better use of time than 5+ hours of killing absolutely no one.

As it turns out, when you shoot the leviathan leg (doing around 1000dmg I believe), it shrieks and then moves the leg for you to run underneath and get the loot.

I wanted to put in some video evidence but every time I do it, I forget to clip it. I’ll have some soon though, so PM me if you’d like to see it.

I feel like this could add alot to the game and change up the meta making it where they dont have to make whole different  characters  and can do updates more often to effect and change the meta
Another one I thought of is maybe when octane hits his Q ability he can double  jump while also getting the speed buff so that way we have another character that can contest pathfinders air mobility",1

The Frontier War is over. After decades of conflict between the IMC and the militia founded to fight them, the region of space known as the Frontier can finally see peace.

But liberation can come at a cost: the Frontier worlds were left barren by the war, and promised aid dwindled to nothing. With no way to support themselves, those who remained had no choice but to leave their homes. The brave relocated to the Outlands.
 
A remote cluster of planets on the fringes of the Frontier, the Outlands are untouched by war and teeming with resources and opportunity. But life is cheap here, and danger lurks around every corner. Its pioneers, explorers, and outlaws used to spend their lives locked in an endless power struggle – now, they settle their differences in the Apex Games, a bloodsport where Legends from all corners of the Frontier compete for money, fame, and glory.

###**Syndicate**:

According to the newspapers they are the organization behind the Apex Games and responsible for ""bringing back life and order"" to the Outlands.
They also have a Rival in planet Talos


**King's Canyon**
 
* ""Once a simple settlement on the planet Solace dating back to the earliest expeditions to the Frontier, the island known as Kings Canyon didn't thrive until a century later, when the now-defunct IMC built several outposts centered around scientific research and development. In fact, it's rumored that the IMC conducted experiments using phase shift technology here, although explorers have yet to find any evidence that proves this. To blow off steam, IMC soldiers stationed here would compete in gladiator-esque combat in an area they nicknamed 'Thunderdome'. Years later, when the Syndicate commissioned the rebuilding of the island of Kings Canyon as the home of their newest bloodsport, they insisted Thunderdome remain untouched - a tribute to the earliest known predecessor of what we know today as 'The Apex Games'""

[An attack on King's Canyon](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/kings-canyon-map-update)


**Leviathans**

* ""Native to the Frontier, Leviathans roam the majority of planets that contain rich vegetation. Although classified as omnivores by the IMC’s Animal &amp; Wildlife Research Division, these 400 meter tall creatures mainly consume fruits and vegetables as their primary diet. The majestic Leviathan may seem intimidating due to its gigantic size, but they are hardly aggressive; considered only dangerous when in close proximity to highly populated areas due to overwhelming power of their movements. To protect research facilities, cities and colonies near Leviathan territories, the IMC developed Repulsor Towers (Dog-whistle towers) to emit high-frequency sounds that only Leviathans could hear, which kept the creatures at a safe distance. However if a tower were to fall, please evacuate quickly - your life may depend on it.""

The Leviathans are so large that they can affect the calculation of jump coordinates of a ship

He said sometimes you only have time to chamber a single round. So you have to know how to do it right. The last thing I said to him was he’s worried about nothing. Four and a half seconds later, I’m watching him-- he’s in skyfall. ‘Worried about nothing.’ Do you know how insufferable that boy will be, sitting on ‘I told you so’ for over a decade? I’ll never hear the end of it. Actually, know what? Print ‘Jackie’. It’ll drive him crazy. But this way, he’ll know it’s really me. Sometimes you only have time to chamber a single round.

If you ask me, it doesn’t matter what side they were on. We all had our own part in the war. No one is truly innocent, so we all deserve help. Like I said, I don’t care about the title, but don’t let that fool you, I am here to win...for them. The Legends are out there...they just don’t know it yet.""

Newspaper Interview:

* ""Why did I become a Legend? One reason: women. I kid. Real reason? Beautiful women.  Sorry. They say I use humor as a defense mechanism, but hello... self-deprecation is my defense mechanism. Humor’s my crutch.  Or maybe my fallback? I don’t know, one of those. I guess at the end of the day, the Games give people a reason to cheer. Aren’t a whole lot of those left in the Outlands these days. Cool to be part of that. All I have to do is die young. So…yeah…anyhoo, I’m just pulling your leg, it’s totally for the babes.""

Newspaper Interview:

*  ""Where did you get this photo? I’ve never seen this before. Do you know, I remember everything about this moment. Know what I’m thinking here? Not ‘I can’t feel my legs’ or ‘are those my feet dangling by the bone?’. No, I’m thinking how cool it is that thousands of people are cheering for me, and they’re still not as loud as the heartbeat in my ears. Tha-THUM. Tha-THUM. Tha-THUM. That was the moment I realized: life isn’t worth living, if you don’t know this feeling. Mind if I keep this, compadre? I love this shot. This was the single greatest day of my life. Mi cumpleaños. The day I was born.""

Newspaper Interview:

* ""I’m Marvin, but my best friends call me Pathfinder. I love being an Apex Legend because that means my banner is on display for everyone in the Outlands to see, especially my creator whoever they are. Competing alongside so many skilled fighters each match is really cool and it makes me very excited to know that I am everyone’s favorite squadmate to fight with; my friend Mirage told me that. He also said that I don’t get sarcasm, which was also nice to hear...I think.""

Newspaper Interview:

* ""I’ve seen a world where I’m not a Legend… and I’ve seen a world where I am. We all make choices in our lives, every second, every day, and those choices...they define us, but they don’t control us. We are our future, not our past. No matter what choice you make, the world you’re in is the world you chose…  Accept it. One day you’re a Legend, the next you’re something else. So be it, nothing will control me.""

*  ""After the funeral, I stood in our kitchen, and it was so... quiet. I had dreamt of quiet like that, but now that I had it, I was terrified. And alone.  I sat on the floor, and I know how silly this sounds, but I hid under the table. That was where they found me. Anita. Makoa. Ajay. Even Dr. Caustic, and he hates everybody. They’d just as soon stab each other in the back. Or the front. But they put that all aside. To support me. The electrician’s kid.  I thought I knew what family was. But my equations were incomplete.

934,To Anyone Who Likes Winning Or Dropping High Kills On Apex,1564110544.0,8,"So there are two types of people. People who play on tv’s and people who play on monitors.

The person with the monitor would win.

I would go into detail but I wanna make this as short as possible. If your tv has the setting put it in game mode when playing apex or any other game to get the response time as close to 1ms as possible. A lot of monitors have 1ms response times and TVs are like 30ms sometimes even higher. 

If you think I’m lying or wasting your time get on youtube and research response times. Just a quick tip for anyone who likes to be competitive but constantly feel like they’re at a disadvantage",1

This sounded ridiculous to me. I thought it was an unwritten rule that when she uses it that she gets first pick and everyone else can have what’s left. She is using her ult, her resources to call in items so she should get first pick not some free for all. To my surprise a couple of my friends, neither Lifeline mains for full disclosure, actually agree that since it’s intensely team based that she has no more right to it than anyone else on her team.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's one that always pops into my head. A squad and I fought our way out of being pinched between 3 teams on low ground near airbase. It was a 4 team fight we got 6 of the 9 potential kills there.  My level 20 and 40 squadmates really surprised me. Final squad was one octane and I could tell he was high-tailing it to the bunker spawn beacon. I knew there was plenty of loot for the enemies in that little town behind bunker because that's where a majority of the fights took place. It was an easy win, right? Nah, when I ping in that direction and take a look at my squad, they're running toward a care package (they hadn't healed yet). I know we all have fully purple loot, so I type, ""1 guy left, he ran to respawn"" and start heading to it. I see the drop-ship and get a little nervous. My team is still healing and slowly walking to the airbase care package. I rapidly ping the ship and the Caustic on my team responds by pinging the hell out of the package. I open my chatbox again and type, ""They have no guns, lets p"". 

I was cut off by a kraber shot to the head. Instead of letting me crawl to cover, Pathfinder revives me in the open. He takes a body shot and cancels the pickup. I find cover, but the ring has been closing the whole time. Caustic who's down in airbase blindly throws his ultimate. The rest happens just like you'd think. I die to storm, team gets shot up running to get in the ring.  The only reason I remember this match is because it was my highest kill game at the time. All said and done, I did learn many valuable lessons in those short 4 minutes, so it wasn't a total waste.",1

I started the song nearly the same second as the intro cutscene began, and...OH Boy, did they sync! Not just the music to the action, but the lyrics were describing several of the scenes in real time! An example is when Octane dies, the music starts to go a little slower, and the lyrics say something like, ""your life is over now, your time is running out."" And right as he gets revived they say, something like, ""so buckle up and take a stand, CUZ NOW ITS TIME TO KILL AGAIN!"" Fuck, I just couldn't get over how perfect it was, so check it out.

982,I think we need a light ammo LMG.,1564066485.0,24,"So while getting my face stomped in last night playing with my buddies I was thinking about what kind of new gun I would love to see added to this game. The weapon selection for the most part is well balanced and has a nice spread of types. Shotguns heavy rifles and machine guns even a PDW style firearm, excellent close range light fast and shredding SMGs etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a gun guy IRL so while others may worry about numbers and balance, ultimates, tacticals, how fast something charges back up or how long something lasts, I just think about what new rooty tooty point and shootys we could be playing with. (Very similar to my life my wife looks for responsible things like pots pans clothes I just look at all the cool guns at my job and debate how to best convince her to let me buy one.) 

&amp;#x200B;

What we dont have is a light ammo LMG. Something akin to the M249/FN MINIMI. High rate of fire, easy to manouver (for an LMG) slightly better hip fire than the Spitfire, and a hefty magazine. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lets say ROF similar to the R-301 possibly slightly lower than that to not make it too much of a bullet hose. 

**Damage**

13 Body 

20 Head

This puts it pretty squarely right in between the SMG and AR platforms for light ammo variants. 

**Attachments**

Muzzle

Mag

Optic

Stock  

Standard magazine size of 40 up to the level 3 limit of 75

**ADS movement penalty** of  X.4 slightly slower than the AR but not as much as the Spitfire or Devotion. Since this will be a softer hitting and not as clunky option in this category. Or even just keep it .4 for balance sake. 

&amp;#x200B;

Great 30-50m engagements and still able to push out to the 150m mark pretty handily but falls off sharply after that. Planting this idea squarely into the medium to medium close engagement range. Gives you the ability to apply pressure at these closer ranges while still having some amount of maneuverability.

&amp;#x200B;

Just something I got thinking about and cooked up. Even thought up a possible name for it Ripcord.

&amp;#x200B;

Wanted to put it out there and see if anyone had any ideas liked this or whatever. Plus writing this gave me a nice break from work while still looking like I am actually doing something. Love to get some feedback and see what the rest of you all have to say!",1

Swazdo-lah, offworlder!

As we re-look at systems within the game, there is one aspect that we haven’t touched in a while, and those are the Augments. As new Augments and new gameplay systems make their way into the game, the older Augments need some attention, and so the team has been assessing what we have and how they can possibly change.

It should be noted that some Augments are tied to abilities that see very little use (such as Pool of Life), however, these will be looked at later on when those same abilities are considered for a rework. For now, this Workshop only covers Augments that we felt we could improve fairly without major overhauls of the base ability as well. They are 'Augments', after all! 

This Dev Workshop is to go over the various Augments we are looking at and our considered changes to each one. So, without further ado, let's take a look at what is under the microscope! Keep in mind, all changes here are impacted by other Mods, this is just the proposed changes to the Augment’s themselves! 


**Hysterical Assault - Hysteria Augment - Valkyr**

Let invulnerability linger for half a second when aiming to prevent getting downed immediately in high-damage areas 

Increased Range 

**Rising Storm - Blade Storm Augment - Ash**

Attacks by clones will raise the combo counter 

Include a passive benefit to extend the combo counter by a duration

**Titanic Rumbler - Rumblers Augment - Atlas**

Increase to damage and speed 
Re-triggering the power will activate the taunt, as well as cause a knockdown effect

**Hallowed Eruption - Hallowed Ground Augment - Oberon**

Additional passive ability that triples base duration

**Furious Javelin - Radial Javelin Augment - Excalibur**

Increase duration and damage on the buff


**Tidal Impunity - Tidal Surge - Hydroid**

Increase the duration of the immunity buff

**Magnetized Discharge - Magnetize Augment - Mag**

Include a passive benefit that increases power range for this Ability only 


**Muzzle Flash - Shooting Gallery Augment - Mesa**

For kills made by a player (self or ally) with Shooting Gallery activated, generate a blinding AoE when threshold is met


**Explosive Legerdemain - Sleight of Hand Augment - Mirage**

Increase damage and status chance when triggered

**Total Eclipse - Eclipse Augment - Mirage**

Increase range on the buff to other players

**Piercing Roar - Roar Augment - Rhino**

Allow Roar to be recast when equipped

Increase debuff duration based on equipped Mods

Generate a stagger effect on enemies when the Roar hits

**Contagion Cloud - Toxic Lash Augment - Saryn**

Allow buff to activate when enemy is killed by damage over time effects

General increase on range and damage

**Transistor Shield - Electric Shield Augment - Volt**

No additional energy drain when a shield is picked up by another player

Increase damage conversion %

**Target Fixation - Tail Wind Augment - Zephyr**

Remove buff after 2 seconds of being on the ground, instead of immediately

Damage increase per target hit


**Fireball Frenzy - Fireball Augment - Ember**

**Freeze Force - Freeze Augment - Frost**

**Smite Infusion - Smite Augment - Oberon**

**Venom Dose - Spores Augment - Saryn**

**Shock Trooper - Shock Augment - Volt**

Holding the casting button will send out a wave (much like similar, expanding Warframe Abilities) giving the elemental buff to every player it touches, including the caster

Please be aware that during this process, tweaks and changes will be made to these alterations provided.

35,"Introducing Warframe Foundry - A tool to track your Item, Warframe and Resource progression and more!",1564062119.0,72,"Hey there.

I always wanted a tool for Warframe in which you can track your mastery progress. And I know there are tools out, that are very close to what I wanted. Usually I make do with an excel sheet, but due to constant updates it gets tedious to update these sheets.

So I decided to create a tool, which uses the public Warframe mobile endpoints and see what I can do with it. And as it turns out, you can do a lot with it.

# Features

* Mark items (Weapons, Warframes, Companions etc.) as Built or Mastered
   * This is also possible with their respective components
   * Built items will be reflected accordingly in the resources section
* Mastery Rank tracking
* Resources Management
   * See which resources you still need and how many
* Your browser will save your data automatically
   * If you need this data somewhere else, Warframe Foundry provides Import &amp; Export capabilities
* Easy to handle settings
   * Hide Built / Mastered items | Hide Images / Components
   * Set your Mission and Junction count to get a more precise Mastery Rank
* Always up-to-date via Warframe mobile API endpoints
   * Shoutout to the guys who maintain the warframe-items [repo](https://github.com/WFCD/warframe-items)

So now that you know the key features, I'm very interested in your opinions and if you like it or not. I'm also open for your suggestions and potential improvements. Keep in mind, that this is a kinda early version, so some bugs are to be expected.

I develop other tools for other games and usually keep and improve my tools for a very long time. Feel free to let me know what you think. Also, just to mention it, on the top right is a small icon to my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Xzandro). If you like what you see, you can support me there. Not mandatory of course. :)

Limbo has access to a plane of reality known as The Rift and can open/close it on a whim. He can even open it up and rip a hole in reality or forcefully placing you into the rift. Ivara has access to controlling any projectile she fires from as small as a dart to as large as a Zenistar disk. Saryn is just a walking war crime with her use of biological warfare. Inaros can devour an enemy or have his fellow Tenno use said enemy as a free health battery. Hell Garuda can impale you on a makeshift alter and siphon off all your blood to heal her or her allies. 

Just imagine how terrifying it must be fighting us for the enemies. Our Tenno and by extension our Warframe are near immortal Demi Gods or literal Gods and can wipe out a entire platoons worth of enemies if we so desire.",0

The current system is rather frustrating if you're trying to use melee, since any sort of aimgliding (an important tool for course correction while moving quicjkly) immediately forces you out of melee and switches you back to your guns.  

As far as I see it, simply allowing us to equip a melee weapon like how we could pre-2.9 in addition to all the improvements that 2.9 brought would be the best of both worlds. 

With equipped melee, it would work just like if you had a melee weapon with no other guns (until you hit the key/button for switching weapons, of course), allowing full mobility while keeping  the melee weapon out at all times. 

But for the most part, I've avoided melee ever since 2.9 came out (excluding zenistar, I do appreciate how much faster throwing out a disc is), and I know there are quite a few people who have done similar things. 

P.S. Please for the love of the void, make it so it doesn't force you to drop a carried item like datamass/powercell while aimgliding if you only have a primary weapon equipped too. This was a very annoying unintentional side effect of melee 2.9.",0

92,Duviri Paradox theory,1564109765.0,1,"The zariman 10-0 that we see in the duviri paradox trailer is from before it returns from the void, not an alternate version. The only times colours are used are

1. The zariman itself

2. The ""flashback"" to the operator leaving his tigris in the hole.

The only other time colour is used is for something from the past. 

My theory is that the operator we see is also from before they manage to leave the void, using weapons they managed to find on the ship while exploring this strange land. I think that as we ourselves are forced to survive in this new place, we will be uncovering what happened during the time that the tenno were stranded in the void, and therefore possibly how they got their powers.",0

116,Hitting a wall on Europa/Jupiter,1564121638.0,1,"Hi all, I just started playing like a month ago and I'm really enjoying the game so far. It took me a while to understand most of the mechanics and things to do, but searching stuff on the wiki has helped me alot (and still does). I also try to read as many guides as I can, but I still have some questions unanswered. 

I've been trying to progress through the star chart, but it seems like I've hit a wall on Europa/Jupiter. The corpus are really tough to kill. To advance, I mostly wait until I can join a squad on the missions so I don't get swarmed. I know that probably means that my mods suck or are underranked, but I'm looking for some advice on what is best to progress.

Currently I am MR6 with Excalibur (30), Nekros Prime (30), Ivara (30) and Frost in the making. I love Ivara and she will be my main, but I'm not sure if she's the best choice to progress the star chart with. For weapons; I use whatever I need to level, so I hardly ever take max rank weapons with me. It feels like I'm waisting time/affinity to level up my MR. For example, my current loadout is Ivara with a Mk1-braton (27), Lato (27) and Dark dagger (23).

I have the following mods warframe/weapon mods which the internet tells me are important to have:

Warframe:

* Continuity (damaged) (2)
* Flow (damaged) (3)
* Redirection (4)
* Steel Fiber (3)
* Streamline (5)
* Stretch (4)
* Vitality (8)

Weapons:

* Serration (3)
* Point Blank (0)
* Hornet Strike (4)
* Pressure Point (5)

And some elemental/crit mods, some of which are ranked up a few levels. I know that for Corpus I need magnetic damage for example, and for Grineer corrosive damage.. But it's a pain to keep switching mods or configs whenever I start a mission. Or is there a better way to do this?

I try to rank up these core mods, but lack of endo prevents me from doing so regularly. Are there any general tips you guys/girls can give me? Can I keep using Ivara or is it best to bring an unranked Frost to the fight? Can I level up frames/weapons while progressing the star chart or should I seperate the two activities?",0

122,Which wisp build should I go with?,1564119147.0,2,"So I'm trying to make something of a nuke/support wisp build, and I'm kinda stuck between two builds:

1. [This build](http://warframe-builder.com/s/94566f4f54542eaa), which has decent damage (173.00%) and duration (151.50%) but somewhat unnecessarily high (145.00%) range.  It's nothing fancy and uses the default mod polarities, so if I wanted to make an alternate build for any reason, I could go off base wisp's stuff. Umbral Intensify is in there because Primed Intensify doesn't exist yet and may never exist, and I didn't want to rank up Transient Fortitude because I didn't want to lose duration
2. [This build](http://warframe-builder.com/s/dfcd9b46db471288), which has better damage (209.00%) and duration (171.50%) but lower range (70.00%). It would require a forma to fit in the fully Ranked Transient fortitude, which could impact other builds, and I didn't want to rank up the Narrow Minded all the way because I was worried about having too little range. I could get rid of streamline and throw in stretch, I guess, but I'm not sure if that's a great idea for wisp. 

I'm still new to modding and minmaxing and all that on my own, so I'm not sure if this is the best way to build wisp and I'm just kind of stuck. I know her motes benefit VERY MUCH from duration AND strength, and I THINK you can get good synergy from breach surge if it's got more duration on it. Comparing the two, 2's boosted version of Sol Gate does \~1.4K more damage than 1's, too. I also don't know if wisp really needs efficiency, but I do like being able to cast her 3 a lot more for this build.

 * Blind Rage / Fleeting Expertise / Stretch / Primed Continuity (not maxed yet)

I see a few people including GHS Leader using Aviator and that makes a lot of sense, but considering you very rarely seem to use her 4, it feels like it would make more sense to throw in Power Drift for that knockdown resistance and extra power boost. 

Cunning Drift feels like it might also fit that slot to make her a bit more mobile and to give her 2 just a tiny bit more range.

I was really hoping they would add some kind of buffer mechanic to the ability where Bladestorm would give Ash and his allies an ability strength buff or something that scales off of the number of Marks used for the cast of Bladestorm.",0
167,Just a thought of concerns,1564122070.0,4,"TLDR: I am concerned about a rise in player hostility recently and can't help but wonder if WF community being able to keep its reputation as one the nicest community in the future.

I started WF a little bit more than a year ago. I am amazed how people being so nice. I can always ask questions, having joke and especially having absolute fun playing with random players. 
Fast forward to present, MR 20 with about 2k hours, in the period of the last few months, I have had quite a handful of hostile encounters. 

- I once commented on a reddit post where OP ask how to do ambulas phisical enhancement sortie. I said I brought Slowva. Then he replied by telling me Nova is squishy and I didn't know what i was doing ( take note that there were plenty of other comments recommended the same idea). He took shot at other comments as well. At the end, he told us all elitist and need to F off. I was dumbfounded.

- Last week, I was on trade chat. A player wtb a kripath riv with range damage and a neg. I shown him mine with range damage impact and neg finishers. I quoted 1k ( i wanted to try my luck, i was open for negotiations). Guy said my riv is terrible bc of impact and tell me to eat a d*ck, then went on and ignore me after that. I just wonder what did I do? Are you not allowed to state your offer?

- On this sub, I saw a post ranting about OP can't get pass that infamous hacking MR test. I (and some others) told him he could use ciphers. For some unknown reason, he flipped out and pretty much told us, you guessed it, to go eat something start with a d. Well, the whole conversation is quite colorful, involving him doubting my ability to get some love from women. Well, I don't know what to take of it. 

- I was told to F off on a fissure defense bc I played Saryn and wouldn't stop nuking ( which is not true bc the mesa was the one who did). I was told that I only wanted to flex my kill number. Well, what give?

- I brought limbo to a sortie defense. I protected the operative ( i believe that is limbo job). One of the players accused me of being afk d*ck. Ok then

Those are some noticeable situations i myself ran into. I can't count how many times I saw players took shot at eachother for no apparent reasons, for example, a noob flipped off a max range mr 25 limbo in an interception mission.

When I fist started, it was so nice. However, things now seem changed for worse. I love this game, especially its community, so much. Seeing it going into decline is heartbreaking. I am currently take some time off of WF. On one hand, mostly because I wanna catch up on Monster Hunter World. On the other hand, I got a bit bumped out by these aforementioned incidents. 
I am glad to see WF grows, but I am also concerned about where it is heading. It seems to me the toxicity has been slowly sipping into the community. I cannot help myself but to worry.",0

Mag Deluxe Skin/model will turn a dark oil like colour entering the plains, it will remain until I leave the plains, it also goes away when in Archwing, sometimes it stays on into Cetus, but that is less frequent.  
This appears to be only Client Side.

1. As I leave the gate, my Mag Prime is a Crimson Red (same as her Cape), this turns to dark oil colour as I stand outside the gate.  
2. As I enter Archwing the colour my frame should be comes back, but leaving Archwing the dark oil colour returns.  
3. As I enter the gate to leave the plains I am the oil colour, but when the rewards screen pops up, the crimson red colour it should be returns.

I know the rule of thumb is prioritized mods go from left top to right bottom. 

As far as charm goes does it really matter if I have it in the bottom left slot as long as I don't have any other ability mods in the top slots?

193,Can Extraction Timers not stop or reset if you die while waiting for it to count down?,1564101193.0,0,"That, and/or make the change to extractions from endless missions general across the board, so that you can always extract when you’re ready even if the randoms you’re with are doing who-knows-what instead of leaving or communicating with you.",0
194,My attempt at potentially working endgame.,1564065781.0,11," 

A lot of people are looking for endgame in the game and is not as easy at it may sound, but I think I got something relatively simple to implement that could work.  
So first, let's point out what are the problem of all the endgame (or at least diffucult gamemodes) attempts we got so far :

* As hard or interesting they may seems in the beginning, they all finish cheesed and not hard anymore.
* In most of case, it's about endless run rather than actual difficulty on a set mission, meaning you have to wait sometime 30-40 minutes before getting the difficulty you are looking for (only old Trials did that well).
* It's generally about kill as much and as fast as possible, rather than interesting objetctives (Trials did that greatly too, especially Jordas Verdict).
* They generally contain exclusive reward, so some people complain about being forced playing to get it, and the difficulty is scaled down.  


Here, the main problem for me is the fact everything is cheesed to easy, and why.  
Basically, what make the game in generally so easy is fact once you get a working setup you can use it everywhere without any restrictions, and as all ""high level content"" is about killing stuff without restrictions about what you chose, the most efficient setup is almost always the same, or at least rely on the same kind of stuff : area nuke build or insane single target damage buff, and as some gears do this better than other, for pure efficiency there is no reason to play other ones.  


To avoid this, my idea is about using a ton of randomly generated restrictions (and maybe buffs ?) to force players thinking differently and theory craft with stuff they usually dont.  
At the end it will be cheesed like everything in the game but the idea is to have restrictions for each mission than make the way of cheesing totally different each time, meaning a big part of the difficulty is to adapt your loadout to the current requirements.  


Before explained more in details the restriction system, I will rapidely explain what type of mission I imagine to better give the context.  
Basically someting 10-15 minutes long if everything is understood and done correctly, in multiple parts :

* Entrance : Entering in the room and go the defense objective, haven't though much about this part but it don't need to be that intersting.
* Defending : a randomly selected defense phase, generally the part where you will the most to kill stuff. Could be mobile defense, adapted interception/infested salvage, hijack. Not more that 3-4 minutes if done perfecty.
* Puzzle : a randomly selected puzzle from a few we have, at best make it modular so it's not exactly the same everytime. Could include spy, first LoR step, plates of second LoR step, simplified JV boss inside puzzle, and few new ones.
* Boss : Just a regular boss, at high level.

The mission is supposed to be real endgame and therefore, the difficulty (and restrictions) are balanced for people owning everything, meaning you may not complete the restrictions depending on your current progression.  
To make it more accessible if necessary, the mission can be split into 3 difficulty, with increasing difficulty and restrictions, something like enemy level at 75-100-150 and respectively 25%-50%-100% of the restrictions, (100% the restriction mean the total number of restriction at difficulty 3).  


Now for the restrictions, they are split in category and mutliple of them on each category are there for each mission. These are just exemples and more could be added for variety.  
The average percentage of restriction for each category will be shown in brackets :  
 

* Warframe restriction : x Warframe is not usable (about 70% of them).  
 
* Weapon restriction : x weapon is not usable, (about 80% of them, for each category).  
 
* Elemental status : x elemental status won't work (about 60% of them).  
 
* Elemental damages : x elemental damage will deal 0 damages, status still work (about 30% of them).  
 
* Warframe conditions (20% of them) :
   * No armor.
   * Shield don't recharge.
   * Power strength/duration/range/efficiency is halved (one of them).
   * Critical damages are halved.
   * Common/Uncommon/Rare mods are not usable (one of them).
   * Madurai/Vazarin/Naramon/Zenurik/Unairu/Umbra mods are not usable (1-2 of them).
   * Power 1/2/3/4 is not usable (one of them).
   * Power get a 10s/15s/15s/30s cooldown, respectively for each 4 powers.
   * Warframe/weapons variants are not usable (Prime, Wraith, Vandal, etc...).
   * Faction only weapons (Tenno, Grineer, Corpus only because infested and sentient don't' have enough).
   * No transference energy.  
 
* Enemies conditions (20% of them) :
   * Critical damages heal enemies.
   * Status effect proc on enemies has 50% chances to affect you instead.
   * Each hit on alarmed enemies will increase their armor by 10%.
   * Alarmed enemies get +500% damages.  
 
* Environnemental conditions (20% of them) :
   * Staying on the ground drain health/energy/shield (one of them).
   * Low Gravity.
   * Wall latch randomly affect you with a status effect.
   * Damages recieved in air/on the ground are doubled (one of them).
   * Damages dealt in air/on the ground are halved (one of them).  
 

I think a weekly/bi-weekly reset cycle for this type of mission would work well. It would let people the time to adapt their build to the situation and craft stuff they are missing for less frustration, while still encourage people to own everything.  
About the reward I think stuff we can get elsewhere but still valuable would be the best option : Forma packs, big amount of endo, refined relics packs, etc... and maybe rarely Umbra forma for the 3rd diffculty unless they want to keep it for Nightwave.  


Let me know if you have anything you would change there, or have idea for interesting mission conditions !",0

I don't want them to have INACTIVEonDISCORD on joining because by virtue of being invited at all, they ARE active on Discord. They *should* be Peasant upon joining, but they can't, because INACTIVEonDISCORD *has* to be below that because it's a lesser rank (meant to encourage participation on Discord; the difference being Peasants can access research, INACTIVEonDISCORD cannot). But then OnHiatus needs to be below that because it's an even lesser rank, denoting extended periods of inactivity (vacation, taking a break for school, playing other games, etc).

Usually when you do a mission in warframe your doing it for a reason whether it be Simaris, a daily, or materials. Now I believe the reason no one plays archwing is because there isn't really anything you can gain from it that isn't easier and faster somewhere else. The only times most people do archwing are for razorback or Atlas. Now my idea to maybe make it a bit more popular is to have uncommon resources like nuerodes have a higher chance to drop from archwing enemy's from their respective planets. Having a way for these resources that might be a bit annoying to get normally in archwing missions  be more common might make it more appealing, especially for things like argon.

211,Random conclave tip: Path of the Gram practice,1564045943.0,0,"One of the biggest problems you'll encounter in the conclave, should that be a sport that you wish to try out, is keeping your cool.

&amp;#x200B;

... and it's a pretty big problem to deal with.

&amp;#x200B;

As anybody who's played will tell you, here in this treacherous hellhole you'll always encounter fast moving targets you can never seem to consistently hit, and folks that can always hit you back with impeccable accuracy every time you join a round of annihilation. This is frustrating, which causes many to panic-fire, which causes you to miss more often and just worsens the problem you had in the first place. So, to help combat and prepare for this, I advise that you practice with a conclave exclusive stance mod for heavy blades called ""Noble Cadence"", more specifically with the third attack pattern called Plunging Edge. Why use a heavy blade weapon? That I'll explain in a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

===How to go about this===

You'll want to begin practice by setting your matchmaking mode to ""solo"" while you're out of the conclave (such as looking at the star map or building armies of floofs in your orbiter), then going to the conclave and playing a few rounds by yourself just to get down the timing. As you get cozy with the pattern, switch to public again and practice that same timing while other people are shooting at you. Don't worry about oro or eliminations, certainly don't bother with trying to be number one (even if you're dead last, you still got in practice), you're here, just, to become, better, and this improvement is marked by your ability to repeatedly pull off that combo, especially under fire. Try to kill who you can, shoot the birds from the air, but always use this combo on every grounded or near-grounded opponent you find. Make note of when and how you screw it up (cuz everyone does, myself no exception), and try to get it to where you can almost do it by heart. You'll probably die a lot before you can finish the combo, and sometimes before the first swing is done, but take pride in knowing you got as far as you did and reflect on your judgement in weather or that was a good time to be swinging. We all make missed calls, all we can do is learn from them and apply what we learned to the future.

&amp;#x200B;

=== Now, as far as acquiring the mod goes, you can either get it through trading with somebody who's willing to donate it to you (comment below and I'll be happy to help), or you can earn it yourself by getting 2,000 standing beyond gaining the rank of Mistral (which you'll be after joining the conclave and earning 5,000 standing to rank up the first time). Good weapons for getting to this rank (or at least they were for me) are the gorgon and gram, although a good argument could be made in galatine's favor that I won't really contest. Gorgon because high fire rate and high spread means you'll still be hitting targets that you're even remotely aimed at, gram because when you inevitably slam attack somebody you'll want as much health in one blow as you can get... just don't follow up with another melee attack, cuz you'll most often die before the first swing. Mind you that below the rank of Tempest you'll be matched with other newcomers instead of the pros, so when you get ready to rank up *into* Tempest...

&amp;#x200B;

...You're gonna get fockin' stomped for the next little bit. This is just basically life, and everybody above that rank in the Conclave either is or has already been there.

&amp;#x200B;

So why practice this *specifically* Plunging Edge? Well, this combo is something that'll really make you feel ""at one with the spirit of heavy blade weaponry"" (if you wanna put it that way). Like the weapons themselves, the inputs for this combo are slow as f&amp;ck but the payoffs they give are huge.

=== Your first attack is a standard swing, and for what feels like the first full second you won't be able to press E a second time (lest you go into your first combo instead, which I'll get into later). Your second input hurls you *WAY* forward into a ground slamming attack that stuns any opponents in a certain radius (provided they haven't already been knocked down in the last few seconds, such as from a slam attack). Your third attack gives you another huge leap forward into an overhead swing that by its nature has a high chance of landing headshots, and for the sake of practice I'd advise keeping the same timing for the input that starts this attack as you used to start your second (waiting a full second rather than spamming E immediately). The incredible mobility boost from this combo is a godsend in the conclave, as anything that stands still is basically already dead, and the whole ""stun anybody nearby"" bit can be a career ender for anybody you can surprise. Pro tip: Hold ctrl while attacking to slide farther, and if you're going to be passing your target then prepare to flip the camera 180 while you pass by (allowing you to double back on yourself and hit them).

=== By comparison, Noble Cadence's easily pulled off 2nd combo (basically hold down right click and spam E) will give you one good leap forward after your first attack, then ***lock you into one place while you do a fancy 360 flip***... basically begging somebody to shoot you as you're not really moving. Mind you that if you press E 3 times in quick succession, even if all 3 inputs are before the first swing is done, you run the risk of being forced into that third attack like it or not. Using this combo is bad practice as 1.) The payoffs aren't nearly as good as those of Plunging Edge 2.) it encourages the same panic-play that's so many people struggle with and 3.) it dedicates you to a set, upcoming series of motions that can only be aimed, not aborted in case of emergency. Mind you that you'll never be able to bullet jump or get off the ground without a ledge while performing a grounded attack (for any melee weapon and any combo you use). For some weapons this isn't much of a cost, but every attack for a heavy blade is a major and time-consuming commitment. Swing when you weren't supposed to, and you could be diving headlong into a trap or flopping about like fish.

=== As for Noble Cadence's first combo (just spamming E), the long and short of it is that you just really don't go anywhere. This coupled with the crippling swing speed of any heavy blade is likely to get you killed before the second attack can even be fully completed. While you *can* swing a little faster by using a slide attack instead, the animation is still long and slow, and you don't move very far in the process. Remember, your religion in the Conclave is *SPEED.*

&amp;#x200B;

Pro tip: Use your 3rd person camera to your advantage to look around corners before you cross them. See somebody standing still? Make your first swing while you're out of sight and aim the camera so that you'll start out moving sideways to your target whenever the second attack starts, this way you don't run into the wall. Turn the camera mid-swing in the second attack to curve and strike your desired target. To them, you just came out of nowhere. Just do all of this quickly because you never know when someone's behind you. You are space ninja, act like ninja of space.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, WHY the hell would you ever want to be using a heavy blade weapon in an environment of fast flying tenno? Believe it or not, in spite of the Conclave's strictly enforced ""move or get your %ss handed to you"" policy, certain people still find themselves with a lot of time spent on the ground. Bow users sometimes stay grounded to aim, or wind up on the ground after aim-gliding while trying to hit a particular target. Anyone engaged in melee combat with somebody else is likely doing a lot of attacks in the air for sure, but even a lot of *those* will be made within a heavy blade's reach from the ground, particularly with Noble Cadence equipped since 2 of its combos feature multiple overhead swings. Now, are heavy blades the BEST weapon to use in the conclave? Eh.... no. Grudgingly I have to admit that the slow attack time usually gets me killed one way or another eventually, mostly by getting shot. The reason I'm suggesting you practice with this weapon (first in solo queue, then in multiplayer matchmaking) is to enhance your ability to *keep. Yourself. Calm.* Breath, think about that second attack, where do you plan to be going? Should you follow up? Are you getting shot at? Will making that second attack get you into a safe zone behind cover? Is it safe to go for a third, and where will you go if you do? Adrenaline stretches a second into a LONG time to consider your options, so take your time. Thinking like this and keeping yourself calm under pressure will allow you to think where to aim, how to move, where to jump, when you do and don't have the casting time for those four different abilities you've got on your hands. Slow the world around you, and in this way you can slowly train yourself to be a better conclave player... should that be path that you think you can go down. Not the right way for you? Perfect! You've avoided the life of torture and pain that I've dedicated myself to learning all in the name of pride, some attachments, and a few Tron-themed weapon skins that I'm still a long way from earning. By all means, SAVE YOURSELF!!!! XD

260,K-Drive options,1564072915.0,2,"Most likely I'm going to get flamed for bringing this up (based on all other K-Drive buff posts) but here are my thoughts.

A) Usable in Operator mode on all missions with 2 modes swappable using change weapon

Mode 1 Movement self explanatory movement and tricks

Mode 2 Combat

   25ish% reduced movement speed. The reduction in speed allows for the K-Drive Power system to put up a shield (affected by mods and/or Operator energy/focus)

   No tricks (can jump)

   Ability to use Amps as well as All operator abilities including dash stealth and blast.

   No chance to get ragdolled off outside of blasts. (KBs from shockwave moas and heavy gunners you just hover over.)

B) Landing tricks provides a speed boost proportionate to the point value stacking up to 200Ish%

   0-25% reduced chance to ragdoll on small objects/terrain.

   Speed boost buff slowly deteriorates at a rate of 10% per second with a 5 seconds delay after completing a trick.

   Speed buff increases on completion of tricks so you can get the full boost in 1 great combo or multiple smaller combos. if you fail a trick or ragdoll you lose 10% of current speed buff.

C) Speed boost/increased handling while on the roads/trails in Orb Vallis identifiable by an aura on the applicable locations

D) K-Drive mod Safety Tether 75% decreased ragdoll speed/distance cap or Mag Boots- Ragdolling Doesn't Cause you to fall off but causes a Knockdown/Rolling animation and you are able to recover with limited loss in speed.

E) Toggleable ability to use Warframe weapons including melee. Melee using boost uses the Forward jump slash animation and increases damage dealt based on speed.

Now I know that this will not compete with arch wings as a mod of transportation in open world. A would allow for more uses. B and C increase the distance they are ""usable"" in place of archwings short to mid ranges. D major QoL improvement due to the amount of stuff that can Ragdoll you. E one of my preferred methods of dispatching enemies using the Archwing is with a Launcher or Arca Plasmor and ""Carpet bombing"" an area flying off to reload and go in for another pass.",0
261,Two ideas for warframe,1564110625.0,12,"DISCLAIMER: I LIKE WARFRAME JUST THEY WAY IT IS, THESE ARE OF MY OWN PERSONAL OPINION AND I MOSTLY PLAY WARFRAME ON THE SWITCH.

idea 1: offline mode

One key selling point of the switch is that you can use it to play games anywhere, unfortunately some games require WiFi to play (and warframe is one of them). I checked my switch to see if it had data but I can't find anything in the settings so if your wondering, no I can't use data, even if I wanted too. One problem I see is the auto save, if you were playing offline than you need to  save manually but I can find an easy solution to this, when the game gets notified that its shutting it will create an emergency exit save(or two in case one is corrupted). If there are any other problems with offline mode leave it in the comments and I'll try to respond.

Idea 2: crossplay

It is very complex but if I'm going to be honest, around 4-6 servers of plains of eidoleon are usually up on Xbox but 1-3 are up on the switch and when I played war frame on the xbox, I could always find a team for almost any mission bit for switch, I find none; this makes players who want to work in teams, forces them to solo, however if we combined all the platforms that warframe is on than finding players who want to do the same mission as you will be far more easier.if there are anymore problems please leave them I'm the comments and remember, these are all opinion-based so don't take this as gospel (I know no one will but saying gospel is better than seriously).",0

279,First-time player looking for some advice and guidance.,1564052764.0,30,"
Hey, all. I'm just getting started on this game, after sinking four or so hours into it yesterday, and just getting a handle on some of the basics. I've read a bunch of the guides posted on the sticky at the top of the subreddit, to get a handle on certain basics, which has been very helpful overall, but there's a number of questions which are maybe a bit more narrow in scope that I'm hoping for some guidance on. 
  
First: I'm wondering about possible costs/benefits of playing as part of a group. Specifically, I'm wondering if playing in a group and not being the one to go around and open up all the lockers and chests and whatnot means that I'm denied the loot contained therein, or if everyone gets a share. Everything I'm reading seems to indicate that playing as a team is basically always the right move, but none of what I've read seems to address this question. 
  
Second: I'm wondering about what warframe I ought to be aiming to obtain first. I got into this game mostly due to people telling me that the gameplay is quite similar to the co-op multiplayer in Mass Effect 3/Andromeda, which I loved, and that seems in broad strokes to be true, to the extent that it seems to contain most of the same sorts of things that I enjoed in those games. This said, the vast array of possible characters is a bit daunting. Typically I find that I most enjoy characters who reward a very aggressive playstyle; characters who are adept at healing/defending themselves. For instance, in Mass Effect Andromeda, there was a characters class called the Juggernaut who got huge damage reduction buffs as long as he was killing enemies at least once every three seconds. That ideally suits my style, and I'd like to see about a character which enables the same type of play. 
  
Third: I'm having a little difficulty finding information on these floaty companion-bot things that I'm seeing around. The fact that I don't know what they're called speaks to my difficulty in knowing what search terms to use to google information on them. Can anyone point me in the right direction?",0

Warframe is one of my favorite games of all time and has helped me get though some really hard times, but the unnecessary jump scares are becoming a health concern for me. 

I hate to make this post because I'm saying being bothered by a problem that isn't even harmful to Warframe or anything players really care that much about, but I don't know how long I can go on like this. I even avoid going to the back of the orbiter or even being on the orbiter because in scared of a sudden load noise catching me off guard and causing minor panic.

I recently got myself a new computer, and likewise I got myself very bored. I have a lot of fun testing out weapons in the Simulacrum and thought I could put that to good use. It's often hard to find flat out, direct footage of weapons doing the thing they do without any interruptions or waiting for someone to stop talking. So, I thought I'd address that need with some easily shareable video bits.

There are a couple that are missing either because I flatly don't like them, don't think they're viable or haven't finished building them yet, but the rest are shown! These are shown *without rivens* as well, so this is to show off the basic capacity of a weapon when invested into with forma!

Per request, [here](https://imgur.com/a/QCMOpOQ) is a companion album which contains every build in the same alphabetical order! I've also gone through and heavily edited/re-tested some weapons as this gave me an opportunity to more thoroughly re-examine my builds.

She can have a balanced build for DPS and support. You can focus on her 3 and 4 for DPS builds.

The most fun however is her raw support builds, as it happens to function as an effective melee build too. Health boost and regen, melee speed buff, and the shock mote gives another 60% damage to Condition Overload by defualt. Not to mention she has a blind!

368,[Suggestion] It is time to revise Sugatras.,1564038190.0,5,"I'm sure a lot of people has already asking for this to be implemented, but let me be the echo from the mountains that maintains attention to this topic: Sugatras.  

Sugatras are considered one of the 'fashion' items you can add to your weapons to add certain 'flair' on it. But sadly, not too many people uses these keychains, despite how good it looks. There's many problems with sugatras, but mainly it's because *how rigid the system of which they're implemented.*  

First point: their attachment points are *too strange*. For most part, they behave like normal cloth-physics item (despite some of them clearly not made of cloth nor should move like one), but slightly oversized charms but once you try and put them on, all strange attachment positions came to light. They're not only awkward, they're outright ugly.  

Secondly: Their sizes do not match with some weapons. Yes, they would do fine with the 'normal' or large sized weapons. But try putting sugatras on smaller weapons like daggers. They'll look outright bizzare because the size mismatch.  

Third: some of the sugatras, like some of the syndanas are locked behind prime access. So on top of it locked behind paywall, it's timegated. This not only limits F2P players' ability to get, moreover use Sugatras that matches with their frame/weapons design.  

Those three are the main points that I'll need to adress before getting to the main topic: how to revise the Sugatra system.  

It's easily can be explained as: let we choose.  

For the first problem: let us choose the attachment points on which we stick the sugatra on the weapons. *ANY* kind of weapons, not just melees. Heck, add attachment points on the Kubrow/Kavat's collars so they could have a 'tag'.  Make the whole of the weapons' surface able to hold sugatra(s), so we could stick it wherever we wanted, *how many we wanted*^(look at point 1b for this).  

1b: let us stick more than one kind of sugatras on a weapon. There'll still be an upper limit, of course, but this would change the sugatra system as we know now: formerly, once you attached a sugatra on a weapon, it will copy itself to occupy all the weapon's attachment points, Now, you need to buy separate sugatras to emulate that. This incentivizes buying more sugatras, aside from collecting one of each type and be done. Of course, the price needed to be adjusted...  

For second point, add size slider to change sugatra's dimension. It could be only length and width, that'll work just fine. For the size, it should be 0-300% of the normal sugatras, to avoid people walking around waving huge 'banners' made from maxed size sugatras attached from weapons.  

For the third problem: make that all sugatras could be either: a: bought with plats, but only releases at certain period of time, with limited amount. This would create incentives to make people stay more, or b: created from blueprints, that could be traded to other players. These blueprints could be offered by Nightwave, Conclave, Lunaro, Baro or straight purchaseable with real money and would serve as attractor to people for playing that game mode/getting more economy going. Because they're blueprints, they also makes people needs to go farming for materials, so more game time.",0

&amp;#x200B;

So I saw a video of someone playing Warframe today, and since I got fancy new faster internet a while ago, I figured I'd download it and give it a go. Thing is, on PS4 I came back after a year long hiatus, and now I'm midway though the star chart, feel like I'm slowing down on power and skills and have no idea on how to get stronger, have no idea what to aim for (I remember aiming for Inaros and stopping midway for some reason, possibly because a midboss kept wrecking me), there's so much to do and no idea what to do first, no idea how to reorient myself on skills and how the already complex systems work ETC

&amp;#x200B;

On the solo side of things, I wanted to start my own solo clan but can't recall why or how I was doing it, what videos i was watching for a good setup. More importantly, when I was looking into info for the coming Ship combat update, I recall thinking ""flying a warship sounds fun but is there, like, a solo player warship I can fly? No? Ok then. DX""

&amp;#x200B;

...I guess what I am am asking is do you feel like the new/returning/lone wolf type of gameplay needs thinking though, especially the first two? and yes, I know it's meant to be more played with people, but trying to convince people to play is hard, and I tend to have hit or miss luck with randoms.",0

Give both her normal and prime variants more hp like 150 at base should be more than enough,
reduce her shields to 37 at base 

It will definitely make it look pretty funny with 111shields and 1110hp (if you equip vitality) but also it would make it very effective as I want to reduce her passive survivability in exchange for a more active survivability

Change her passive from faster knockdown recovery to 25% damage to health is converted into energy

Her 1 can stay the same it's just a mobility tool and her augment is just so horrible that I don't wanna touch it even with a orthos prime with 4 prime reaches equipped

Her 2 should give guns half of the buff so at base it's +50% armor +50% attack speed +25% fire rate, but no slow debuff to enemies
In addition, her augment should allow gun kills to give +1s to the buff while melee kills still give +2s

Her 3 should go completely and be remplazed with something like a jump at 1 enemy that does 5% of the enemy's hp as finisher damage while also healing Valkyr by 10% of her max hp in the process
The augment could be something like the heal Valkyr gets is also given to her allies in a 20m range

Her 4 shouldn't make you invulnerable and it shouldn't give you life steal, instead it should have far more melee range represented by making her claws slightly longer it should also have slightly more melee damage
In addition it should have two special abilities that cost around 25 energy(non modable) if you do a jump attack you throw a explosive projectile in the direction you're aiming (with no self damage), similar to exodia contagion that does around 3 times your melee damage, and if you do a ground slam it should do a sort of rhino stomp in a 10m radius that makes enemies fall to the ground and slows them by 30% modable and capping at 50%
Her augment should add back the 5% life steal and make Hysteria stop draining energy instead it will drain 1% of Valkyr's max hp per second that scales over time up to 5% of Valkyr's max hp per second

First question. Is there any must have frames at this point? Frames I have or am building currently:
Excalibur, Frost, Inaros, Mag, Nyx Prime, Oberon, Rhino Prime, Loki, Nova, Volt and Ember (if I can ever get the systems blueprint) 
I understand Nova is used a lot in endgame as we as Volt? I’m aware that there is a couple other frames I can farm up currently. I’m mostly interested in which ones it is worth investing potatoes. 

What are some of the nightmare mods I should be looking for? I’ve got a list of must have corrupted mods which I need to farm. Any other must have farmable mods?

That’s the two main points I’m stuck on. I’m way behind on weapons in that I actually don’t have that many built and ranked up. So any weapon suggestions are welcome. My main weapons right now are Ignis or Hek for primary Sonicor for secondary and Broken War or Boltace for melee.

Maybe there would be a group of Dax who survived the Tenno rebellion, and came across the Sentients.  
Perhaps they received an order to eliminate the Tenno at all costs, and seeing as how the Orokin were crumbling, sought the power of the Sentinels to do so.  
If they do exist, they will see Teshin as a traitor who allied with us 'demons'.

392,Would a crafting time multiplier for newbies work?,1563966455.0,49,"One issue often encountered by new Warfarm players is the long crafting times.

Many of us are already used to it, but not the newbies. Waiting for your 25th Warframe doesn't feel as long as waiting for your 2nd, even with the same wait duration.

Moreover, the platinum rush button gives the impression that Warframe is similar to one of those cash grab crappy mobile games that don't have a lot of contents.

Hence, I think it would be a good idea to add the crafting time multiplier based on the Mastery XP to improve the new player experience.

Why not MR or the number of weapons in inventory? Because both of them can be abused: I've seen MR0 doing Jordas Verdict raid.

Example (might need some tweaks):

0-2500 Mastery Points (MP) = 0x the normal crafting time

2500-10000 MP (MR1, assuming the account ranks up) = 0.05x the normal crafting time

10000-22500 MP (MR2) = 0.15x the normal crafting time

22500-40000 MP (MR3) = 0.3x the normal crafting time

40000-62500 MP (MR4) = 0.5x the normal crafting time

62500-90000 MP (MR5) = 0.7x the normal crafting time

90000-125000 MP (MR6) = 0.9x the normal crafting time

125000+ (MR7+) = normal crafting time

&amp;#x200B;

That way, DE still gets to keep their beloved crafting time and newbies get a better experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: add crafting time multipliers for low MR players based on Mastery Points

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit:**

I'm collating the responses from other people below:

1. Abused by staying in MR0 - that's why use points instead of &gt; ranks
2. Abused by not using newly crafted weapons - no difference from doing stuffs normally if you instant craft weapons but keep them in inventory/foundry because you're not using them
3. Might make players feel punished if they rank up - suggest to add newbie bonus instead? See next point.
4. Newbie grace time for a few weeks with accelerated/instant craft time? Might be a good idea, thoughts on this?
5. Free rushes for each account? Might be a good idea, but may give the feeling that the rushes are ""too valuable"", same condition as legendary cores - often feels too valuable to use.
6. Cutting down craft times for low MR items? Might be a good idea but will eventually cause the same feeling/wrong expectation as those ""gawd it now needs 14 weeks to craft one high level thing"" in crappy mobile games.
7. Low MR weapons purchasable with credits? Might not teach newbies about crafting? Thoughts?",0

Host migration is disgusting, having to endure another player's bad connection is disgusting and the fact that Digital Extremes is making hundreds of millions per year gives no excuse to not having dedicated servers.

This is even more important with the squad link, imagine that same Tennocon gameplay but with disconnections and host migrations.

I would be disappointed if Digital Extremes launches Empyrean without dedicated servers. The nightmare of having a consistent gameplay getting cut off by a crappy networking system.

416,People are sleeping on Baruuk.,1563956485.0,80,"This frame gets a stupid amount of  hate. And stupid hate. He's one of the highest EHP tanks in the game,  has a reliable aoe CC and on-demand finishers, apparently gives up to 90% DR to teammates with his daggers which I just found out, and does serious damage  with his 4. it hits through walls and isn't limited by verticality.   slam with right click sucks enemies in. right click combo doesn't  stagger mobs. Slide attack does a bunch of crazy things, I'm still  figuring it out (headshots apparently?).

I  built Serene Storm for crit and corrosive/cold damage, max power str,  and Condition Overload. And combine it with a corr/rad/blast Mara Detron  (can also use Zakti but Mara procs 4 statuses guaranteed with  punchthrough). I think it's best to mod his 4 for crit and play with a status secondary, which resembles a hybrid melee and scales very well into high levels.

SS 1-2 shots all trash well into high levels on its own,  and just that makes it worthwhile given its crazy mechanics. Tougher targets like  Gunners are stripped and blown up by CO + Mara. Tigris Prime for  Arbitration drones (used with Vigorous Swap). I like Redeemer Prime on  him if mob density is low and I can't manage Restraint well, but a  hybrid Kripath would be godlike as well.

I  did several longer Arbies and ESO runs, and I can relatively easily  keep up with Saryns in both damage and kills, and sometimes surpass  them. All this with zero risk given his damage resistance.

Baruuk  got a huge buff with melee 2.9 as he can use his primary or secondary  without swapping from SS, so I'm not sure people are aware of this. I  find most don't build his 4 correctly (i.e. with CO), and fixate on how  bad impact damage is, which is true in a vacuum, but not as relevant  when looking at this frame as a whole. my *only* complaint about Baruuk is that I don't ever find his 1 useful (2 and 3 drain Restraint easily). his passive is also godly. Some people call him the old Wukong, and in a sense he is due to being nearly immortal...but he brings a ton of CC and disarms with his kit, giving him a decent amount of utility as well. And SS is just hella fun.

anyway,  just trying to bring some attention to this massively underrated frame, and I hope some of you are enjoying him as much as I am. Here's my build if anyone is interested (not my build, lots of Baruuks are running  it).

[5 forma. Vigorous Swap is flex. ](https://i.redd.it/6hjd1u00o7c31.jpg)

[There's no such thing as \\""too strong\\"" in WF, so I see no reason why SS status chance shouldn't be buffed to about 30&amp;#37; baseline. But even without good status chance, it just works...and scales when modded with CO. ](https://i.redd.it/0k0h513eo7c31.jpg)",0

&amp;#x200B;

Stats: good energy pool, tissue paper survivability.

&amp;#x200B;

Passive: makes travelling 25% less painful.

&amp;#x200B;

Spellbind (1): Hard reliable CC on enemies, cast on self/ally for status immunity, especially against bosses with magnetic procs; spam for activating (4) augment.

&amp;#x200B;

Tribute (2): cast on ranger enemies to reduce enemy accuracy around, cast on melee enemies to gain chance to reflect attacks, cast on tanks to lower enemy movement (but not action) speed, cast on proxies to gain nothing (almost), does not scale with any warframe range, strength or duration mods, lasts 120s.

&amp;#x200B;

Lantern (3): cast on any enemy, granting it invulnerability and taunting nearby enemies. Unreliable CC.

&amp;#x200B;

Razorwing (4): gains 6 tissue papers to distract enemies, which respawn when recast. Titania in Razorwing shrinks, gain evasion, and becomes better archwing that knows how to stop. Can cast (1), (2), (3) in (4). Shooting in (4) shreds all enemies with slash-focused exalted pistols. Melee in (4) allows for life gain when modded right, only used when in a pinch. Do NOT cast (4) on ground. Augment \[Razorwing Blitz\] drastically increases movement speed and fire rate when abilities were cast, effect and duration stacking up to 4x.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/2ijyzq7dq7c31.png

Build priority: Efficiency =&gt; Strength =&gt; Duration =&gt; Range

&amp;#x200B;

Aura \[Growing Power\]: Status procs grants 50% power strength, can be used to snapshot (4) and activated by (4)’s weapons.

Replacements: \[Pistol Amp\], \[Energy Siphon\], \[Corrosive Projection\] (situationally used against enemies that are immune to status).

&amp;#x200B;

Exilus \[Aviator\]: DE finally updated it to work with (4). Grants flat damage reduction in air and in (4).

Replacements: \[Power Drift\] for more damage, \[Cunning Drift\] for more range, \[Enemy Sense\] or \[Vigilante Pursuit\] for enemy radar.

&amp;#x200B;

\[Quick Thinking\]: Survivability mod, utilizes Titania’s energy pool to stop enemy one-shots.

\[Umbral Vitality\] Survivability mod, Health is more useful in combat than shields, boosts other umbral mods.

\[Transient Fortitude\]: Strength mod, duration loss can be neutralized.

\[Fleeting Expertise\]: Efficiency mod, duration loss needs to be neutralized.

\[Primed Flow\]: Energy mod, increases pool for survivability and lasting power in (4).

\[Narrow Minded\]: Duration mod, butchers range, used to neutralize duration loss.

\[Hunter Adrenaline\]: Uses health to generate energy, cushions one-shots with \[Quick Thinking\]. When low on energy, chip damage can be used to generate energy. Energy can be used to generate health using (4)’s melee.

\[Umbral Intensify\]: Strength mod.

Replacements: \[Primed Continuity\] for reduced (4) drain and longer (1) and (3), \[Blind Rage\] when more burst is needed while lasting power is not needed. \[Razorwing Blitz\] for insane burst and movement. \[Natural Talent\] to not die while casting abilities. \[Umbral Fiber\] to further buff the set.

Not recommended: \[Energy Conversion\], does not work on (4)’s pistol damage (tested in Simulacrum in early 2019), \[Adaptation\] without dedicated tank set up Titania cannot survive anything but chip damage.

&amp;#x200B;

Arcanes: \[Arcane Velocity\] replaces \[Razorwing Blitz\] and removes the need to bump into doorways.

Replacements: \[Arcane Energize\], \[Arcane Guardian\].

&amp;#x200B;

Focus (post-The-War-Within): \[Zenurik\], prioritize \[Energizing Dash\] and \[Energy Pulse\].

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/58zqmctjq7c31.png

Build: Standard viral hybrid set up. \[Maim\] to increase raw slash damage and lean bullets more towards slash procs, note that it does not increase slash tick damage. Can replace with \[Augur Pact\].

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/wnxicxblq7c31.png

Build: Raw damage build. Activate channeling for \[Life Strike\], regaining health using little energy. Avoid frequent usage as pistols do too much damage compared to tin opener.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/43iol4emq7c31.png

Build: \[Hunter Munitions\] set up. Guaranteed cold proc for \[Growing Power\]. Can replace riven with \[Heavy Caliber\].

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/9ucgadsoq7c31.png

Tombfinger-Killstream-Haymaker

Build: Hybrid Build. Guaranteed status proc on direct hit for \[Growing Power\], status procs double-dip with initial hit and explosion. \[Pax Seeker\] because \[Pax Bolt\] does not work on (4) (tested in Simulacrum in early 2019).

Replacement: Catchmoon also has guaranteed impact proc when shot at enemies within 10m.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ufdvml2qq7c31.png

EkwanaJai-Seekalla-PlagueKeewar

Build: hydrid \[Condition Overload\] set up. \[Clashing Forest\] for guaranteed impact proc for more damage. \[Exodia Epidemic\] for CC. Can replace riven with \[Drifting Contact\] or \[Organ Shatter\].

Replacement: Any melee weapon of choice because if Titania melees on the ground, things go badly.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/n01ftmrsq7c31.png

Build: \[Rewaken\]\[Sacrifice\] set up. Helps when soloing as Titania. Do NOT put on \[Fatal Attraction\] or attack precepts because they guarantee death for Djinn.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/d0zuomwuq7c31.png

Build: Stat stick for other weapons. Use other set mods such as Gladiator to buff melee if wished with a \[Deconstructor\].

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Playstyle: Use \[Energizing Dash\] at start of game. Find energy orbs to fill energy pool. Proc \[Growing Power\] and pop (4). Cast (2) on 1 ranger and 1 melee enemy. Recast (4) when tissue papers falls below 3. Cast (3) when guarding objectives and in a pinch. Cast (1) to avoid magnetic procs when needed. When out of (4), Stay on the move and in the air when in combat, take cover when regenerating energy.

443,Could we have a Warframe based all around gun play?,1564047108.0,19,"What does everyone think of this? I don't really have a full concept of this myself, like all the cool ones that have been seen around the front page, but I think it could work something like this:

This frame could be a gun support frame with buffs that increase fire rate, reload speed, projectile speed, maybe crit/status, spawns ""Ammo packs"" to restore squad's ammo. Could also have an ability that gives different effects to different weapon types:

Bows: Arrows automatically seek enemies' heads, as long as they get within an X amount of radius to it (imagine a mini Mag bubble around every enemy's head).

Snipers: Can see enemies through walls.

Rifles: Each bullet splits into multiple parts as it passes through the enemy's body, and each part is automatically launched at another enemy within a 60 (can increase with mods) degree cone behind the initial enemy hit, for reduced damage (Power Strength leads to less damage reduction).

Beam weapons: Increased range and beam width.

Spearguns: Can be recalled from infinite distance, and once thrown, remains where it lands indefinitely.

You get the idea. Obviously needs some fleshing out but seems like something we don't have in the game as it stands.

Not sure what the fourth ability could be, maybe an Exalted beam weapon? Or launcher? But then again, we might be getting a bit inundated with Exalted weapons now.",0

does anyone have a link to building a sweet bow with lots of flashy procs?

also, i did some research on my own, and rhino seems like maybe a good choice, with the run in, slam, get a health boost then spam arrows. thoughts??

I joined a pug survival fissure mission and carried on till about 20 mins or so when another player went to extraction. I followed as I had real life stuff to do and 20 mins more than enough for me.

I had dropped 3 radiant relics in that time. The other 2 guys must have been in a squad and refused to extract.

The first guy who went to extraction just left and I ran about for another few minutes trying to figure out how to leave the mission. In the end I had to abort mission. I couldn't see any other way.

Firstly, did I miss something? Is there a way to extract solo and keep your rewards?

Secondly, what's the etiquette here? Is it just bad luck that I was paired with some guys who didn't want to leave or should the whole team leave when one goes to extraction?

Either way, I want to avoid in future what appears to have been a complete waste of time and resources.

461,"The Zhuge Prime, small suggestions",1563996199.0,3,"Firstly let me state that I really dont care about self dmg, Im ok with an AOE weapon having self dmg.

That said, the explosion delay tremendously hurts the zhuge prime. It not only forces the player to use it like some sort of burts rifle in order save ammo, in my opinion its the main reason why players get killed by it. It basically makes any melee unit to a suicide bomber thanks to its one second delay, which is enough time for it to get near you. In addition if you kill the target before all arrows detonate, you'll be wasting a lot of dmg.

Also the passive is incredibly annoying and is only really useful thanks to the forced 3s reload duration of the weapon. This just punishes players for playing smart. 

In order to fix these issues I would like to suggest these fixes:

* Delay: Just make them detonate on impact, this alone would make the weapon a whole lot more useful.
* Passive: Make the 1.5s its base reload speed. If a passive is required, something like ""On empty reload double the magazine capacity"" would be a much more desirable one.",0

After 40-50 hours of complete mess, my friends and me quit the game, me mostly because I've been everywhere in the game, but had very little understanding of it. I've returned in June 2017 and started with a new account that I play on to this day. And today I decided to have a look on that abandoned account and I've found some stuff I kinda regret with the current knowledge of the game. I thought it would be interesting to share some results of a newbies' mindset of that time:

* I was MR4. Friends traded me Ember Prime parts that I crafted and used.
* Never got into clan.
* Never potato'ed anything.
* I thought 150k credits were a lot. I think I've even bought plat-to-credits conversion once.
* I ended up with 1 plat by the moment of leaving the game. And little amount of slots.
* I've bought Daedalus shoulder armor from my first Baro. Priorities, I know.
* I've maxed out Rush above all other mods.
* I've unlocked classic and saturated color palettes.
* I've incubated a Raksa doggo and almost immediately sent it to PETA because credits.
* I've crafted regular Boltor, maxed out and sold it. At MR4.
* I've crafted regular Latron and sold it after couple of levels. At MR4.
* I've farmed and crafted Seer and sold it after 3 levels. At MR4. I am crying right now.
* After crying, turned out I have almost enough parts to craft 2 more Seers. Looks like Vor fight was my jam.
* I've crafted Tiberon and apparently it was the shit after all since I managed to level it up to 17.
* I think I've almost forma'ed Cronus or Heat Dagger.
* I remember that moment of excitement when I finally figured out the planetary map. The moment that was ruined by the fact I needed to do spy missions to unlock some bosses (I love spies now tho). One of the reasons why I've never finished Maroo's quest.
* I've farmed Nove Prime BP, Bo Prime BP, almost full Sicarus Prime, Glaive Prime parts, Carrier Prime BP. Stuff that I could've made a decent plat from these days.
* My current progression is a clusterfuck. I have access to most of the quests pre-SD, but most of the junctions are now locked and requirements are not fully met. However, I have managed to get to Sedna back then and opened random nodes across the entire game. And I don't have Void nodes unlocked aside from Teshub.
* My build was Ember Prime, Strun, Viper and Orthos. And Carrier of course.
* My friends list shows that my peeps were online almost 1.5 years ago. One friend was online 1094 days ago.
* I still have a shit ton of nav segments that I can sell for 5 credits. From the look at Eris segments, it seems Tyl fight was my jam.

Alright so this might be long so I don't expect people to answer everything, but I'd definitely appreciate some help if possible.

1. Should I get new warframes? I'm currently using Valkyr, I only have her and Excalibur right now and I'm not too big on either, so I kinda looked up some warframes and thought mesa looked cool so I'm planning to get her when I get to Eris. I also have 2 parts of mesa prime - the chassis and the main blueprint so I could potentially get the prime version instead if I get lucky with the relics (although I'm not sure how to get some of the parts). Should I just cycle through random warframes for my mastery rank (6 rn, about 80% to 7) or try to find warframes I know I'll like and farm those up since I have limited slots?

2. Which are fun weapons? They don't necessarily have to be good endgame or something but I just want fun stuff. I'm currently only really using cernos for my primary but I have quanta, strun, boar and drakgoon as well, atomos for my secondary but I also have aklex and twin vipers, and galatine for my melee but I also have volnus and broken war. I'm really enjoying these so far but I learned that cernos is kinda bad (which sucks since I used a potato on it) so I feel like I should switch it up, but I still want something fun.

3. What should I currently focus on? Getting through the junctions, leveling up mastery, getting important frames or weapons etc?

This was the initial email about the delay:

&gt;Dear Tenno who pre-ordered the Excalibur Umbra Statue: 

&gt;We have an important update about your order. The expected ship date for your order is mid-June. If you have additional items in your order, they will ship once the statue is ready. A confirmation email will be sent out once items have shipped.

This was my support ticket on June 28th:

&gt;Hello Sgtflexxx,

&gt;Thank you for contacting us. Due to the overwhelming support for these Warframe pre-order items, it has taken our manufacturers longer than anticipated to create and send the Vitruvian Shirts and the initial batch of Umbra statues to us for shipment. As soon as we receive these items to our warehouse, we will make sure to send your order as quickly as we're able. We apologize for not being able to give a more precise date for shipment. Please know, when your order goes out, we will make sure to email you with a tracking number so you can monitor your order's delivery progress.

531,Looking for semi-advanced advices,1563970190.0,8,"Hello fellow Tennos!

&amp;#x200B;

I recently gave Warframe a second (or was it a third?) chance... and it clicked. Empyrean trailer have reignited my interest in the game. I just unlocked Ceres and gradually advance in building Rhino and Mag frames. I enjoy the game so far - it has a nice tempo and some very cool ideas.

I studied a lot of beginners guides like iFlynn's so I think I'm decent with basics (modding, mastery and affinities, rifts farming, etc.). What I would love to see are some a bit more advanced advices. Here are some things I'm struggling with or just wondering about.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Pace of the game

The pace had slowed down a bit after moving to Mars. I'm talking about introduction of new gameplay mechanics or items, not actual mission gameplay. While not being a bad thing, I'm just wondering if the main part of the game has the same pace. I'm not against a little bit of grinding because Warframe has quite generous drop rates. I had played a lot of Ragnarok Online so current loot system is ok with me.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Rare resources

Some rare resources (like Neurods or Control Modules) are actually rare :) Are there any recommendations how to get them beside just playing?

&amp;#x200B;

3) Is there any way to make Archwing controls on Nintendo Switch feel better?

Although Archwings have a cool idea (yeah, I grew up watching Gundam and playing Zone of the Enders and Super Robot Taisen series so I'm hooked up) its kinda hard to control them. Switching from Pro Controller to dual Joycons in grip helped a lot with motion aiming. But I can't find suitable settings to make Archwing feel... controllable? I constantly crash into debris around maps. Keppler mission (Phobos) was just unfun because of this (although I managed to complete it with 2 out of 3 transporters destroyed).

&amp;#x200B;

4) Should I look for an active Clan or just playing solo or with public sessions would be ok for nice game experience?

From my own experience being in a guild/clan means that you should participate in clan activities like raids and so on. I had led a few quite sucessful guilds in different MMOs but right now I don't want to sink so much time into gaming anymore. Warframe is fun to me with its short-session plays. I'm not sure if I will stick to this game for a long time so I don't want to create high expectations from me as a player. I am not looking for taxi or any help actually, I'm wondering if social and coop aspects of the game are worth getting into a Clan.

I know the suggestion is usually to report people at the [support site](https://digitalextremes.zendesk.com/hc/en-us), but I feel like I'm running into people constantly enough that it'd take an actual time investment each night that I play at this point just to make tickets.

535,"I know it will never happen, but at some point I would love to see this added.",1563933174.0,10,"Unique frame heights, for those of you that don't know, all frames are almost completely a uniform height. Of course this is so armor, syndanas, etc will all look uniform.

I have enjoyed the designs of hyldrin, atlas, and now grendel for pushing against the norm and putting more definition into their character silhouette. 

In my mind I believe it wouldn't be that hard to do, however I know the work in it can be much harder than it looks or seems.

564,"Suggestions for a ""voice message"" overhaul",1563959775.0,2,"Hi! Since I saw a lot of suggestions regarding glitchy Lotus or Ordis in general, and how annoying Lotus can be after doing the same mission for a long time, or Onkko when he thinks he has to tell us after every single eidolon limb that there is an energy spike coming. There are 2 suggestions that might solve this situation. I think these could even work well together, with having the option to turn off these messages, or buy an entirely new one.

1. Just let us turn off every voice message. If not entirely, I would be totally fine with the message still appearing, so I can read the message if I want, but you can mute the talking part if you want. In case someone would forget to unmute it before starting a new quest for example, the game could give you a little warning about your voice message volume being disabled.
2. There are games out there selling ""announcement packs"", mostly mobas, but I feel like it could work in this game too. In this game, they would simply replace glitchy Lotus with someone else. Of course, they would be only for normal missions, and not story missions with a predetermined story, but being able to buy for platinum an ""upgraded Ordis"" pack, or even our regular ""Ordis"" pack instead of glitchy Lotus would be a nice start. I understand, recording voicelines for every mission wouldn't be that easy, so I would accept a higher than usual plat price for something like that.

TL:DR Let us either turn off the voice messages of every character in the game outside of story missions, or let us buy new ""announcers"" for platinum to change things up a little bit.",0
565,"Thanks Warframe, it was a hell of a ride",1563811827.0,470,"Warframe was probably the best game I ever played. Not just because of the game itself, but also because of the incredible community and developers at DE. No other game I've played in \~20 years of gaming has had the communication and interaction with the dev team like Warframe, it's truly one of a kind. This past weekend my gaming rig died.

568,Some thoughts on NW Profit Taker,1564017679.0,8,"Gonna begin by saying I've been soloing Profit Taker since it was available on PS4. I personally don't have much or any trouble with it, depending on how much I let my skills rust in between. Archgun rivens have made it significantly easier than even before.

I feel that Profit Taker as a Nightwave chore is a poor move on DE's part. As stated, I can handle it alone, and it's an easy elite weekly objective for me. But I think the bar for entry is too far along for it to reasonably be an objective for *every* player to have. I see the following trend when it comes up, every time it comes up:

*""Where's Profit Taker?"" ""Why can't I fight Profit Taker?""*

And after the above are answered

*""That's dumb."" ""I can't even get to Old Mate Rank before the week is over, so I can't do it."" ""Can I get a taxi?""* (And taxis do not work for PT)

Which leads to

*""Nightwave sucks!""*


Now, I've read and heard that we don't need to do every objective to make rank 30 by the end of the season. I am fully aware of this. I just have concerns about putting any objectives, especially the most valuable ones behind a progression wall as high as this one, and then taking no measures to actually inform players of it. 

The NW objective makes it look really simple. ""Defeat Profit Taker."" It sounds really simple. It doesn't tell us the things that players need to learn the ""fun"" way. You must me max rank ""Old Mate"" with Solaris United, and then must have completed all of the Profit Taker missions up to the last, where you take it down. If you can. Kit check inbound.

As an objective, the fight is fine. It's tough until you have the kit and knowhow to get it done. Even then, you still get killed by what appears to be nothing often enough to stay on your toes. 

The issue is the combination of the progression wall, not making those prerequisites readily known to players, and having the Nightwave screen make ""Defeat Profit Taker"" seem like a trivial chore like doing three spy missions.

581,"""Praise the Warframe"" Weekend Mini Event Idea! (Name under debate)",1563914903.0,4,"Hello, Tenno.

&amp;#x200B;

I had an idea for a fun recurring weekend event geared more to newer players but that older players might be interested in as well and I wanted to share it.

To start I want to mention that all values can be discussed and constructive criticism is welcome!

The idea is this... A random Warframe whose components are obtained through a drop table mechanic (so drops from bosses or enemies, or from specific mission rewards like a specific node or Sanctuary Onslaught) is *praised* for a weekend.

**Weekend Long Event Details:**

\-Warframe specific component drop rates are doubled or tweaked to become easier to obtain as a reward.

\-Using the chosen Warframe in any mission grants Credit/Resource boost and slight/moderate increase to all stats.

\-Universal Bounty(ies) (similar to Nightwave tasks) centered around *praised* Warframe, such as getting a certain number of kills, traversing a certain distance, getting enough finishers, etc., which upon completion grant an exclusive Warframe specific cosmetic! \*Touched on later\*

\-Warframe cosmetics (such as alternate helmets, immortal skins, stances, and noggles) are discounted and **may show up as alerts for a short time during event.**

\-Augments are discounted and other areas where the *praised* Warframe appears in-game that I may have missed can be modified.

&amp;#x200B;

**Thoughts:**

With the growing number of Warframes by the update, and more to come, I think it’s becoming an ever-growing mess and headache for new players to choose which Warframe they want to get. Increasing the drop chances and temporarily increasing the number of players using the praised Warframe makes for a **fun opportunity for newer players to feel motivated to progress in the Star Chart and farm a hard mission to get a Warframe they don’t have yet.**

This may also be appealing for players that have already gotten the praised Warframe because the bonuses you get by using that Warframe can be very useful. Players that don’t play that Warframe very often might be encouraged to dust them off and break them out for the weekend, possibly changing their view on that Warframe. And players also have the opportunity to unlock a cool highly exclusive cosmetic for that Warframe that others will be able to see. ***\*\*\****

The cosmetic is an evolution from earning an event Emblem that no one uses, and instead is some sort of slight visible alter to the *praised* Warframe whenever you use that Warframe which shows that you completed their task(s) for the weekend event; Could be a subtle trail effect that doesn’t interfere with Ephemera but gives your Warframe a visible glow, could be a new helmet for that Warframe that takes one of the existing helmets and alters the model slightly to make it look cooler or more thematically extreme based on the Warframe (more stealthy or menacing), could be an entirely new exclusive helmet or skin, could be a Warframe specific Syandana that also compliments the Warframes theme.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion!!**

The possibilities for this weekend event are vast and have a high potential to bring in new players through the opportunity of advertising the Warframe Weekend event. This could also be complimented by offering discounts on platinum packages and maybe some more goodies to new players.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel as though Warframe doesnt have enough content like this which is time limited to one weekend, and isnt constrained to doing a single mission a few times for some common rewards and being done with that event after an hour. This type of event brings excitement and preparation.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If you’ve read this far then my thanks go out to you immensely. I love sharing Warframe related theories and ideas and hearing what others think as well.

After reading some suggestions and finalizing some of the details I’ll try to send this to the forums and see what they have to say about the idea.

593,New player here. Would love some insights regarding a few stuffs.,1563912783.0,13,"Hi guys! I'm mastery rank 2 to 3 now and finishing on the second planet. I am really loving the game so far, but it has a fairly high degree of complexity involved. I would love some insights according to your own experiences.

1. What should I focus on early? I mean, generally the recommendation I see is ""don't spread your resources too much"". But is there any stuff I can grab early that will help my progression? I got the Mesa blueprint and it seems like a great frame for instance, could I build it or better sticking to Volt? Which weapons are nice? I don't have resources to try and experiment, at least yet..
2. How server/instances work? I was with a squad last night and when I joined the city, it was FULL of players everywhere, all from my location (Brazil). As soon as the leader left the squad, I was put into a empty town instance with like 2 people that didn't seem Brazilian at all. I am on the South America shard, tried resetting the instance by relogging, exiting the game and reopening, joining the desert and coming back... To no avail. How can I control this?

I probably have a thousand other questions but I'll just learn most stuffs by playing. My IGN is Knuckledust13 if anyone wanna chat, hang around or shoot some stuffs together =)

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

THANK YOU very much for all the recommendations, guys! I am having extreme amounts of fun with the game, taking it at my own pace and farming out for Rhino. Already got 2 parts! =) the only thing bumming me out is having to level up these starter weapons instead of using new ones, everyone recommends doing that but they seem kinda bad haha",0

601,Social expectations with public queuing?,1563935490.0,24,"I've started to notice I tend to piss off my teammates more often lately for various reasons when playing public.

Another was because I accidentally set off an alarm in a spy mission when the guy wanted to ghost all three and I didn't ""sit tight"" like he told me to. Today I pissed someone off for trying to leave at 20 mins in a survival mission when a squadmate wanted to go ""all the way"". It seems there are expectations when queuing public that I'm not aware of.

* When am I allowed to leave a defense or survival mission? I know now that leaving at 5 is unacceptable, but how long do I need to stay minimum before I can leave knowing I'm not screwing over my teammates?
* If I do need to leave before others, how much advance warning do I need to give?
* For spy and rescue missions, is it wrong for me to join public ones if I know I can't ghost the whole thing reliably?
* Should I join one-off missions if I know I can't handle the mission solo to begin with?
* How high tier of a bounty should I be able to solo before joining random public groups in the open world?
* Should I be able to joining open world bounty public groups if I don't have a fast archwing to keep up with the squad?

What are other expectations I need to know and follow before joining public missions?

She'd be a trap oriented tank frame with a CC exalted weapon coming from her shield.

Stats:

Health:100-350
Armor:700
Shields:75-175
Energy:150-350
Sprint speed: 1.5


Abilities:

Passive: Natures shield: when Anklio shield isn't active Saurian takes reduced damage from behind.

First ability: Ankylo Shield: Saurian takes her shield from her back becoming a weapon, while in use Saurian takes no damage within and area of effect.  Shield does increased knock back for minor impact damage, used more for crowd control. Area of effect can be increased with range mods. Damage can be increased both in exalted weapon menu and with power strength mods.

Second ability: Claw Strike: Saurian drags her dewclaws along the ground striking up flames in an area of effect launching enemies back. Deals heat damage

Third ability: Tar Fields: Saurian spews from her tail a massive field of hot sticky tar slowing or trapping enemies. Deals minor gas damage over time. Tar can then be ignited with heat abilities or weapons burning enemies trapped for additional heat damage. Tar evaporates after being ignited. 

Fourth Ability: Cataclysmic Meteor: Saurian fires a massive meteor into the sky that comes crashing down dealing heat and explosive damage,  the center of impact has the highest damage point degrading as its radius expands. Center of impact and size of meteor can be expanded with range mods and damage can be increased with strength mods.",0

628,A small fortuna tale,1563949911.0,5,"Once upon today a nightwave objective came and demanded that i am to kill the profit taker

i accepted this task for there would be a decent reward in nightwave standing.

&amp;#x200B;

To fortuna i went and equipped myself so that i was ready to face the spider with 3 strangers.

however once i entered the elevator all hell broke loose. at first i was not suprised or even worried. 

afterall the game lagging when entering fortuna was not unheard of.. however it would soon be obvious this was no ordinary lag.

&amp;#x200B;

After 4 minutes of being stuck in the elevator even though it had seemingly finished loading it let me leave into the cold outside world and my hud indicated that my team had already been fighting the profit taker. but the lag did not stop. i had less than one frame per second and only every 4-6 seconds i had a brief image of the current occurings. i could see that my team was dying but i could not help them for i was stuck near the fortuna entrance. as i tried to activate my archwing the deploy sound was played but there was no archwing so i ran into their direction.

&amp;#x200B;

as i could see the profit taker on the horizon after minutes of struggling against the lag and freezing cold i had received a simple yet terrible message and it said: ""Connection to the host has been lost You'll be returned to multiplayer menu now"".

then my screen went black

&amp;#x200B;

when my vision cleared up again i could see only my desktop with the taskmanager on it. warframe was not on the bottom list of windows nor was it to be seen in my task manager yet for another 10 minutes my computer was stuttering and freezing. shuddering in pain as its soul was being sucked out by digital extremes. i know i should never have asked them to buff the ballistica primes special ability.

&amp;#x200B;

yet after those 10 minutes were over something even more scary happened. the warframe loading screen popped up with a stuttering and lagging ship with the generic angelic choir. for anothe 5-8 minutes i sat silently contemplating my life as i was stuttering into fortuna with the mission results of my previous mission on my screen. a nightmare mission.

It was really simple: you run in, grab a thing, and run to Extraction. The end. This pyramid tile was where the objective was located in the Void.

[It looked like this.](https://imgur.com/a/yvvc6IG) (Images by u/Melos-Mevim)

It was added to Sanctuary Onslaught some time ago, or maybe on its introduction IDK, and the more I think about it, the more I think this would be a great Defense tile. It's big, wide open, it has a PERFECT spot for a defense objective (on top of the pyramid).

Right now, the Void only has one defense tile. While its current tile is definitely fine, I think only having one is a bit... few. Especially since there are two defense nodes, Taranis and Belenus. Maybe one could have the old tile and the other could have this, or they could both alternate. I just love the tile, I'd love to see more of it, and I think slotting in for Defense missions would be a great new use of an old asset that they evidently still have ready to plug into the game.",0

658,Unable to collect rewards in Sanctuary Onslaught unless I’m hosting (PS4),1563940524.0,1,"On the first or second conduit appearance, I *always* experience a lag spike. If I’m playing in a party, the left side that has the zone timer, efficiency %, and zone # never update again. As soon as this happens, I am unable to obtain rewards (stayed for 10 waves once just to see if it would connect later).

With no way to guarantee hosting (I set my ping to 100ms, the lowest it goes. Lag spike on the first portal, no rewards on the second) I tried solo. I can’t match the killing potential of 4 people, and am unlikely to complete zone 8 (which means I can’t craft Khora).

The oddest part about this, is that literally every other game mode has absolutely no issue at all at giving me my rewards. And upgrading my internet isn’t an option, as my only two options are a local service and Verizon (and the local service is actually the better one). So is there any way at all to make sanctuary zone timers and therefore rewards also happen client side, leaving the efficiency on host?

(And I’m sure there’s a build I could use to go solo this easy, but I’m not asking for builds. I’m just asking to be able to earn the rewards I worked for in public groups)",0

As it currently stands 2019.07.25 there is ""double dip"" with **bane of grineer mod** \- it is used 2x in calculation of **slash proc** on target - see testing.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, you should be careful with formulas, addition, multiplication and percentages.

I stumbled upon this thing and checked few videos on youtube and what the hell!

&amp;#x200B;

Wiki gives correct examples for calculation with **rhino roar**?

[https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Rhino#Abilities](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Rhino#Abilities)

&amp;#x200B;

1 ) You exclude variables when testing, means testing without mods!

&amp;#x200B;

2 )  buff is  *multiplicative*  !

&amp;#x200B;

From wiki

250 × (1 + 30%) × (1 + 50%) = 487.5. with 30% intensify  + roar (**Ability strength**)

100 × (1 + 165%) × (1 + 50%) = 397.5.  with 165% serration + roar (**Damage mod**)

Then I saw the Railjack demo.

Hoo mama I immediately reinstalled and started catching up on shit. The last update I played was the new parkour and Equinox, so the only story quest I had played was Natah. My old clanmates guided me through the rest of it the last couple days, and now I'm back to a point where I can just mess around with fun weapons and make them OP, which was always my favorite part of this game.

There's just one problem though. I don't remember how the *fuck* this game works. Getting through the story was easy enough because I could just use my already busted frames and weapons to W+M1 through the quests, but now that I actually have to engage with the systems again, I'm lost. My clanmates are helping where they can, but I thought I'd crowdsource some questions:

• I used to have a pretty good idea of what mods I had, what they all did, and which ones worked best on which weapons, but now I can't remember any of it. Is there a guide for best modding practices? On that note, is warframe-builder.com still a good resource?

• What's the endgame now? I remember mostly running void missions and vaults for high level gear, but now the void is its own place?

• What should I even be doing now that I'm caught up on story? Plains of Eidolon seems *super* overwhelming and I have no idea how to even start with that or what I would get out of it. What's my next step?

1. I want a weapon that strips armor with corrosive and causes slash damage. This weapon should be primary weapon because I want the twin to use it. So far Zhuge Prime seems to fit this slot but when I google what people think about Zhuge prime there's a lot of hate. Is there a better option for the twin? I would also use it to kill all non bosses and bosses that doesn't resist slash.
2. Secondary should be a heavy hitting weapon that can take down condition resisting bosses and I would rather not let the twin use this so I would prefer it to be the secondary weapon. Right now I'm using Euphona Prime. I'm not sure how I like the weapon but I have seen videos about it doing nice damage to the bosses that resist conditions.

Any ideas or tips?

713,Help with Volt Prime build?,1563926252.0,22,"So.. Volt was my first frame, as with many on here I'm sure.  Managed to get Volt Prime (gift from buddy actually), and he's easily one of my most used frames even with having acquired about 15 more since then.

I guess I'm trying to make an optimized 'general/nuke' build, and 'speed' build.. and then maybe last one will be for idk, whatever specialized things Volt does best lol.

First question.. best overall polarity for auras on Volt? It seems to be Naramon, is it Naramon? lol Anyone use Madurai, or is general consensus that the dash is best for the dasher.  Or, again, is Steel Charge too valuable?

Second question.. I noticed a few builds using 'augur' set mods, is this relatively viable? Especially in lower Forma builds (like only 2, which is what I'm using.. but considering going 3).  If I use like 2 augurs I can easily fit exactly everything I need to the single capacity in my 'speed' build, I suppose.. but I'm still not sure if it's optimal or not.

Third question.. the age old, shields vs health debate (or does anyone even use either on him?).  For him, I feel like he's one of the few, if not only.. where shields might be really worthwhile, for instance with.. capacitor and augur mods.  Obviously I wouldn't use this for every config, but maybe some kind of support build or something..

Tho my current ""main"" I guess is Oberon Prime, at least until I find something I like better (tho I do love really Oberon so that may not happen) - so I guess what I'm saying is.. if there's anything Oberon can do better (tanky high level survival/defense, support, or eidolons) then I won't need a config for Volt to fill any of that.

Ive always wanted a wolf themed frame based on Fenrir from Norse mythology. He'd have digigrade legs, a pointed helmet with ""ear points"" and an operable maw. He'd even come with an auxiliary piece putting wild fur on his back and shoulders. Hed have a unique sprint animation having him run on all four limbs. His body would be able to bulk up with his passive and 4th ability. He'd come with two Exalted weapons, one being a Two Headed Helimith Charger named Hadi &amp; Skol, and his claws and maw. 

Stats:

Health:150/400
Armor: 650
Shield: 50/150
Sprint speed: 1.75
Energy: 120/180 


Passive: Unchained Rage: Armor health and ability strength increase by 5% for a max of 25% with each ability cast.

Hadi and Skol: Summon a two headed Helimith charger: each rank is a new command like Vinari, new command heal, Hadi and Skol will pounce and maul enemies gaining healing sending a portion back to Fenrir. Hadi and Skol benefit from Seething rage.

Ravage: Fenrir pounced on a target mawling them healing for 15% of the damage. 10/25/75/100

Seething Rage
Howl that stuns enemies and buffs allies damage by 25% for 3 seconds. Hadi and Skol will also howl adding to the stun range.

Ragnorok: Fenrir bares his claws and his muscles expanding in size, Fenrir gains up to double armor and damage, switches to exalted sparing claw weapon. 50 energy to activate with 5 energy per second of use.",0

731,1000 Friend cap is coming.,1563824226.0,77,"Forum link: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1113786-fyi-1000-friend-cap-is-coming/

&gt; Greetings Tenno,

&gt; This PSA only pertains to a handful of you, but as I am part of that handful I wanted to take the time to explain a coming change so that we are all on the same page:

&gt; We are applying a 1000 Friend cap to your friends list.

&gt; I’ve certainly been pushing the technical limits of this with my ‘Accept All’ mindset, and as a result I have many errors that are entirely unique to accounts in the 10,000+ Friends range. Many of your favourite games and services have capped friends lists, and we will soon follow suit.

&gt; Your Friends list is more than just account IDs - we always look up their current Alias, selected avatar, last playtime, active missions, and more. Doing this for thousands of Friends can involve hitting huge database pages, and it affects performance.

&gt; This will be coming a few weeks from now. Anyone who logs in after the change who has more than 1000 Friends will be able to keep them all, but unable to add more. We will be adding a few ‘mass delete' tools as well to help you shrink down your list.

&gt; Thanks for understanding and we will let you know when we are closer to releasing this change.

All the frames, weapons, palettes, cosmetics, tennogen, orbiter decorations, what have you. If he needs resource for anything he just buys it. He then realizes that there is a ton of mods that should be owned as well. Opens warframe.market and buys everything (or wants because he would be locked by MR).

744,Hypotesis/Suggestion for an italian inspired Warframe.,1563919094.0,9,"A lot of warframes have been inspired from different cultures and historic population. But i never saw something italian.

So here's my hypothesis To create an italian cultured Warframe:

Lets start with the name. It could have a lot of hypothetical names:

- Roma, Florence or Venice (or any other ""big but not too recent"" city if you wanna take the name from a city) 

-Scylla or Charybdis (if you wanna  keep the mythological aspect)

-Harlequin or Pulcinel/Punch/Pulcinella (if you wanna keep the folkloristic side)

-Badalisc (A mythical creature of the Val Camonica, in the southern central alps)

-Giufà ( a way to describe a ""village fool"" in some areas)

There are a massive list of names that could represent italian history (so massive that i could make an entire post only on cool names with historical depths)


Then lets define his ability:

In this case i had to take basis and inspiration from 2 warframes in particular: Octavia and Inaros

-Octavia is The warframe of sound, is like the dj/composer of the group (octave= octavia, *wow congrats me*) the key word is sound


-inaros is the Ancient Egyptian god of the warframes, everything is based on sand, (like ancient egypt) the key word is sand

(but if im gonna be honest, basically every warframe's ability is made in this way is based like that for example excalibur = sword ; mag = attracts stuff... basically this whole explanation is useless ig you already know this but whatever...)  

By going by this logic what would be the key word of an italian frame? 

Well, this is hard.

 Why?

Italians are famous for a lot of stuff but only one can be applied to the warframe world, here's a list of a few ones with an anthitesis if translated to the warframe world:

- Food: 
it could be a nice idea. But whats his purpose on the warframe world? Food is rarely (or never) seen in the warframe. So its a no, unless the food can be translated to something with the same value.

- Design: 
this also is a good idea, but usually the orokins are seen as the perfect beauty in the warframe world. So we could change it as if it could be the stylist of the warframes (with maybe giving fancy and huge customizations) 

-Music:
We have already Octavia.

-Mafia:
At first, it could look like a bad idea, the warframes are usually seen as saviors, but also we have harrow, which is like a cooler demon. (Also this could give a whole new quest about some ""lost and evil frames that form a gang controlled by a bigger frame, kinda like the mafia"" or something like that... you can also inspire this from jojo and vento aureo).

If you have any other ideas lemme know.

Lets define his design:

It cant be anything before the roman empire, because the orokin already resemble that style (and also a bit of the story).

Alternatives are 5: 

-something about renaissance
 (but not vitruvians or similar statues, because still, orokin style).

-something folkloristic (like with harlequin and punch, you could inspire from the original costumes, and since those two are neapolitan, you could even enforce the ""mafia-based"" style).

-a giorno giovanna clone (could work, it has italian, and other stuff that could fit the warframe world style)

- a runaway frame (take inspiration from gucci/fendi/versace runaways)

-a partisan inspired frame (""The rebellion"" the ones that opposed the regime... sounds cool but partisans doesn't have a design that could fit the warframe world).

And that's it. 

Lemme know if i missed something.

I hope i made sense with my explanation on why it does fit.

EDIT 1: Mirage is inspired From Harlequin, so the Harlequin idea is scrapped",0
745,I replaced Cetus sky into Orb Vallis (Warm),1563792085.0,20,,0
746,Hildryn is forgotten,1563918064.0,40,"﻿as a main of her for the past 6 months. No other frame has﻿﻿ ﻿made﻿ me dropped playing my inaros﻿ then﻿ her. Her niche of shield energy playstyle worked out for me alot more better than I thought of. A mix of tank, offense, defense and support. She has been the most fun frame I've played since I first got valkyr and inaros. 

 ﻿

 

Now after a few months, wisp is released and is a far more popular choice for casual and hardcore. So much﻿ so, She got 5000 skins all ready lined up and ready to go. Hildryn playstyle with shields doesn't sit well with anyone but a few werdios like me. Maybe her interactions with infested or hp based foe﻿s would be better if her 2 can take hp and make them shields for her. Maybe have her four be less situational. Buff to her 1. Any attention is welcomed when wisp got one to her 4. 

 

One of the things I fear with hildryn and her relations with the community and DE is being neglected. Wisp kit feels compete and feels fun to use for many. Hildryn's kit feels rather confusing to many that tend to not get it. On top of that, her niche is that every thing is shield based. Powers, ability to tank all with. I feel like with a few more polish to her kit. Maybe she can have a easier barrier for anyone to try her out. That is if DE remembers her to do so. At the very least, I did picked up gara again. Gara had a rough start and was quickly forgotten by many. But around the end of last year, she started to regain some recognition. Due to DE remembering her as a frame. And giving her some buffs and kick ass augments mods to boot. I hope a year from now, hildryn gets that treatment. Instead of thrown in the trash like what most want. One man's trash is a another man's treasure. 

 

Tldr: I hope DE doesn't forget to buff hildryn﻿ i﻿n the﻿ future. I'm a bit salty about it.",0

759,"[Contains spoilers] The Second Dream, a new player's perspective",1563803322.0,123,"Funny, just a few days ago I posted a meme that I'm a brand new player and I have no clue what is going on for the most part when I play. The meme was directly related to the fact that I still have no awareness of the game mechanics, the warframes, their abilities, weapons, the majority of the enemies and so on and so forth.


When a friend finally convinced me to try out Warframe, I came in with the expectation of playing Diablo 2 but in third person. Go around, slash and smash stuff, go out, get loot. Sure, it seemed to have some depth given you have such a variety of options you can but then again, how much depth can you get from a game like that? I settled for the idea it will be just a somewhat decent way to waste my time.


As I started off, I saw my Excalibur thrown on the ground out of his pod, soon to be left for dead. I slashed my way through it, I made my way out of Earth, I explored the star chart as I was putting the pieces together, being the righteous hand of the Lotus, striking down the enemies left and right, believing I'm working for a greater good, for a just force. I grew closer to the Lotus as she welcomed me into every missions and was there to guide me along the way.


We hunted relics, treasures, fragments of the past, the majority of them causing even more confusion rather than clarity, but always side by side, guided by the hand of the Lotus as my blade sunk into each consecutive enemy. Until that one quest that brought back an ancient message. Up to that point, the Lotus was always there for me, but this mission took me to edges I haven't seen before. Weird, specter like creatures, appearing out of nowhere and disappearing in the same manner. Little did I know that in that very moment, the Lotus will wish me to stay safe and go into radio silence. I was sat in the cave where I just managed to snatch a scan of the creature so sought after by the Lotus, but now the radio was silent, a growing feeling of a bad omen, I ran as hard as I could to the extraction point, I was scared, I did not know what I was fighting.


The story progressed, I learned more about the Lotus and my bond with her felt shaky. I felt hurt. There has been a lot more that was unknown to me. She was more than just a being on top of the command. She had something to hide, something dark enough to enough hide from us, her most loyal soldiers?


This was no longer just hack and slash, this was a path to redemption, was my frame just a tool, blind to the Truth, led on a path for all the wrong reasons? 


Little did I know, I should have been long gone, vanquished by the very same hand that instead brought me back from the dead. It was a bittersweet feeling; knowing I've been lied to, but for all the good reasons. Knowing that the Lotus wouldn't betray me and my fellow Tennos, that we are her harbingers and always will be, spared by her mercy, ready to strike at her command.


As I continued spurring through the star chart, little did I know the bad omen would come to be - the Stalker, guided to hunt down and destroy my own very kind. The hunt was one and I was determined to reverse the roles in this one. I shall no longer be the prey. Without going too much into details to avoid spoiling the story, I quickly learned that maybe I have bit off a piece that's too big to chew. Going through the hoops and witnessing the moon was a breathtaking experience. The field of the final battle has unfolded. There was nothing else to do now, no other variables in the equation, it was just me and the Stalker and one of us wouldn't see the sun rise anymore.


I ran through the golden halls, struck in awe by their beauty, saddened by the decay that has come to lay waste upon them. As I rushed through the rooms, trying to outrun my very destruction lurking those halls, searching for the very essence of the Tenno, I couldn't help but listen to the voices whispering of an age long before, realizing we were hushed, yet there was a kind heart willing to protect us.


I found the Stalker and he found me. I found me. He found *me*. I was speechlessly watching the cinematic. All this buildup, all those missions, all those fallen enemies, it all led up to this. I couldn't bear it to realize the actual truth; I wasn't playing just a warframe, there was more to it. It was a beautiful moment of re-awakening and connecting back to the very body of my operator's mind and the music, oh God, the music!!


I made my way back to the ship, I witnessed the last heroic effort of my warframe as it crushed the Sentient and banished the Stalker. And that's when all doubt of the Lotus was removed. My redeemer and destroyer, once set out to vanquish my kind was now yet again taking me under her wing in the my most vulnerable moment.


Thank you, DE. And I can't stress it enough, thank you. I started Warframe with the idea it will be a mindless shooter game, yet, as my Operator laid in that pod, I realized I felt complete. I felt the satisfaction you get when you finish a good book or a movie. I truly believe the development of the story so far was a masterpiece and closing it up in that manner, jeez, I couldn't ask for more. 


I wish I knew who worked on that, who created the levels, who put the pieces together, who chose the music and MY GOD, who took the decision it will play again when you walk back into that room after it's all said and done! Thank you, to all of you who did that, it was an amazing journey that brought me a lot of joy. The night I finished that quest, I felt like I was playing an entirely different game, I didn't want to do any other missions for that evening because it just felt **too damn good** to close this chapter of the story.


I liked Warframe before those few quests. I love it now.

Yesterday I finished the Chains of Harrow quest line and i found quite a bit of weakness of the gameplay. If I had to put the experience into one word it would be: Pacing

My problem starts with the mission was that it put me into an ""alien Isolation"" mood real quick in that eerie phase in the early stages of the quest line where you go to the abandoned ship. I absolutely loved that part and even started to slow down; no bullet jumps, used the scanner to do ""reconaissance"" and progress slowly. But then from one moment to the next the phantoms appear. At that point i was at a peak of excitement... 


..until I one shotted them and got reminded that this is warframe after all and I am way to powerful. I immidiately began to bulletjump and run for the mission marker. 

I was kinda disappointed by this, because it brought a nice change to my gameplay loop for a while and I'd like that to be that way for a bit longer. 

I think that mission could be made better with, either making the phantoms untargetable and have them move through you, or make the phantoms have much more health, although I am not sure how difficult it is to balance stuff out when people hit the place with different gear. 

Then when you go back to the steel meridian base things are well paced again. I walked up to a guy that also let me trade in insignias while chilling there, I looked at each soldier there thinking there might be an interaction. generally a good and calmed down place. 

These parts were irregular when it comes to pacing, the later parts with the tarot cards and the emotions &gt; that have the face were an awesome part, just like the ending which was also very good both in fighting and storywise.",0

815,My concept for a Uranus open world: Aithiopios!,1563869049.0,3,"Reposting, since I didn’t even realize I kept typing Neptune instead of Uranus D: anyway, seriously love brainstorming ideas about lore and stuff like this, mediocre as I may be. Anyway, here is my concept, I hope you like it!! There may be a few run on sentences, I apologize as sometimes when I get going to forgot to end my sentence haha. Enjoy &lt;3

Aithiopios: Corpus Naval metroplex, northern oceans of Uranus.

Little Duck: “Hey Tenno, one of our radar’s picked up a destress signal from a Aithiopios  on Uranus, not even the Grineer are crazy enough to attack such a fortified Corpus city, something isn’t right about this. The corpus have been upping the demand for metals from here on Venus, as well as requests for military support have been reported by are spies in other corpus colonies. Something is wrong Tenno, these people can’t afford to work harder then they already do, and if the Corpus are exposed, that gives you an opportunity to land an important blow. Do what you do best.”

Aithiopios .... a floating Corpus city, used as the basis for the naval side of corpus army as well as home for the richest of corpus generals. Manufacturing naval fleets for the corpus armies and housing important generals in luxurious towers that can be seen rocking in the horizon of the oceans of Uranus for miles. No middle class in corpus nations, either as poor as Fortuna, or rich as Anyo Corp. 

A spreading infestation grows through the city after infected meteorites landed on the city outskirts, causing failure to the flotation systems of effected building. Some portions of the city have sunken underwater due to this, leaving us with a map split between aquatic areas and synthetic land with infested below the water slowing sinking the city, and corpus above defending from their still supported city-scapes. Imagine a coral reef of infestation, teeming with a hive mind of life, built on the foundation of sunken corpus skyscrapers. 

Along with this an aquatic eidolon style fight. Ancient ruins of battlefields ripe with fallen sentients lie deep under the oceans of Uranus, and the infestation is beginning to corrupt the long since dead as much as the living, resurrecting horrors of sentient war. Alternatively, they could simply do native aquatic wild life of Uranus as an eidolon style fight rather then another sentient base for the creature, large shark/eel creatures, or massive squid.

As well as expanded gameplay with fishing such as nets that can be trapped to lure in fish, or a new aquatic submersible that can be used to study/capture aquatic life. 

Instead of a day/night cycle they could work on a toxic/clean cycle in the water. The infested germination spreads even more violently through the water, and as spores are released the water becomes to dangerous even for a Tenno. Preventing access to aquatic areas, while also causing the horrors of the deep to seek shelter from the infectious waters on the cold steel of the corpus city. 

This could also lead to community events, where we choose to further crush the weakened Corpus base and loosen their grip on Uranus and lowering the stress on slave colonies like fortuna, or purge the infested alongside the corpus, saving Uranus, but giving the corpus their footing back. Eventually resulting in the end of the plague, or the total sinking of the city.

I hope you like the idea, I’d sincerely appreciate any criticism as I do want to start getting better at crafting ideas like this.",0

817,How to survive when using a frame that has no innate survivability option?,1563860959.0,44,"In Arbys, usually I have to play on a team where no one brings a frame that can give me survivability (Gara, Octavia). So I have to rely on myself to stay alive. However, my frame of choice does not always have a personal survivability option. Which means no (reliable) damage reduction ability, no rift plane, no invisibility, no absurd amounts of base health/shields, nothing. So frames along the lines of Saryn, Frost, Khora, or Mirage (I love using her but her DR is laughably unreliable).

I've been looking to rectify this issue so I don't accidentally touch a Tar Mutalist Moa puddle and get vaporized before I can use Magus Elevate/Repair. So far, I have no luck. Vitality/Adaptation/QT + PF are the only options I've found, and they can't really do much. No operator abilities or arcanes seem to do the trick either.

However, apparently it does, but then some sources say the golden prime bits would still remain, which would imo ruin the Tennogen skin, other sources talk about there being a toggle to show or hide the prime bits, then other sources again talk about that toggle not functioning properly (prime bits still showing), then it sounds like the state of this is not the same for all Prime Warframes...

846,"There's an... interesting, buggy interaction between Nidus's passive and Exodia Contagion's self-damage.",1563818777.0,5,"So, Nidus's passive is supposed to prevent you from going into bleedout if you have 15 or more mutation stacks. But currently, there's an issue where it acts weirdly with the Exodia Contagion Zaw arcane. Before anyone asks: I unfortunately haven't been able to record this.

Basically: if you have 15 or more Mutation stacks and you were to die from self-damage caused by impacting with your Exodia Contagion dart, not only does Undying not proc, but you don't even go into bleedout-- you just go straight into the respawn screen. 

After a bit of testing, I've found a few factors:

1) This bug doesn't occur if you're in a solo session and/or are the host. It can only happen if you're a client.

2) If you die from self-damage with less than 15 stacks, you go into bleedout like normal.

3) This bug happens more consistently if you have more than 15 stacks-- I've usually gotten this issue around 20.

It's a pretty niche thing, admittedly, but it's still a pain to be flying towards a Grineer to hit them with your Zaw, only to run into your own dart and being forced to use a respawn.

What if I do, let's say, 10 excavations from the appropriate node, and just start farming mobs?

Hydroid slides down his esophagus and into the stomach. Hydroid then turns back into a solid, and rips the captain's entire body in half from the inside.

I have read that the vaulted Void Relics operate on a cycle, does that mean they reappear after a set amount of time?

So the blueprints/parts in the current Void Relics will be vaulted at some point in time?

Is that the reason why the Void Relics are numbered?

Should you, if possible for you, wait with trading prime parts until they are vaulted as it will drive the price up?


Again if this is clearly explained on the Wiki, I would like to apologise again, but I wasn't able to find a section that answered these questions to my satisfaction.

Then for polarities one has to again grind 30, then again again again and again.

Who the fck decided this system was great?

It's pointless mind numbingly boring Hydron runs over and over and over. This is not good game design or does not provide any meaningful rewards.

This system needs changes.

* Allow players to allocate their formas on polarity slots all at once and ask them to grind again to 30.

Or 

* Reduce the subsequent levels required after slotting a forma to level 10 or 5.

Also allow people to craft Forma in bulk, I have like tons of Forma blue print and they are just sitting there and eating dust.

Different varieties of Forma is not an answer to this shit.

This game is great, but shit systems from very old age doesn't have any relevance in today's game. The game is filled with content and so much stuff to do.

There are already enough things to grind and feel rewarded. This system is outright bullcrap.",0

912,A New Frame Idea,1563866584.0,2," 

I have a new Frame idea...Probably this came to my head after watching Spiderman far From Home xD

The frame sounds like a mix of Atlas and Chroma but hear me out about the abilities

Lets not talk about the frame name lol..suppose he will be someone like Mysterio

His passive : He will be invulnerable against all type of elemental dmg by rotation(fire ice toxin magnetic) so 10s of heat dmg invulnerability and then 10s of ice dmg invulnerability like this..one by one

1st ability : He will buff all type of dmg which squadmates will deal but in the same time his own dmg will be nerfed but u can balance that by killing enemies (each enemy kill will balance that nerf by 5% and so on)

2nd ability : He will absorb the elemental dmg and return/payback that dmg with double amount..so if u absorb 50 slash dmg u will deal 100 and it will repeat...it seems op..so to compensate this..this ability will be highly energy consumable...

3rd ability : he will create a dome inside which enemies will be constantly attacked by some flying mini dragons(something like tatsu charges)

4th ability : He will summon all 4 types of elemental giants depending on the stacks u fill..yes there will be a meter to fill..suppose u want to summon fire giant..u have to kill enemies with heat dmg to fill the meter and once its full u can summon the particular elemental giant but after that giant is killed u will be weak against that element for 50s..same for other elemental giants too..if u are fast enough to stack up all 4 elements somehow u can summon all 4 giants altogether

In concept this is a really cool mod! The bonus is strong, useful, and opens up some interesting builds. A slightly longer duration would be nice, but the current one is usable. The condition, though? Extremely frustrating!

Bullet jumping or double jumping to activate an effect is fine. We do both of these things all of the time. The trouble is that Motus Setup doesn't kick in until you've landed. ***This is incredibly anti-synergistic with the Motus set bonus, with the rest of the new mobility mods introduced with the Gas City remaster, and runs counter to the incentives of moment-to-moment gameplay itself.*** Yes, there are ways to land sooner - you can slam out of the air or aimglide to cut short your jump. But the fundamental problem is that Warframe generally wants you to be airborne to move around, to get better angles on enemies, and to evade and avoid damage. Staying airborne is just more effective and more fun.

Luckily, this is a really simple fix: just make the condition be ""after bullet jumping or double jumping"". No need to land - except to reset your jumps so you can trigger the buff again!",0

I know that Loki  can use his abilities more freely, I know wisp's decoy only goes in one direction and doesn't shoot at enemies like Loki's (but I mean who's gonna use the decoy for dps) , I know wisp is only invisible if she's in the air and I know she can't switch places with enemies (but I mean when have u ever been playing Loki and think "" u know what would be really useful, switching places with that lvl 13 scorpion"") but would u rather all those abilities + give enemies instant autism so that they drop their guns, refuse to pick them up and attack the first thing they see OR would u rather all those abilities + most literally a portal to the sun that will apply all the sun's force unto the baddies, think about it. I know wisp will never be able to replace Loki and how it feels to play him but to be honest what's the point in getting Loki if u can get a slightly worse version of his kit AND 4 other abilities. The way I see it wisp is a flying Loki. I'm not alone in this opinion, I've told  DK, he agrees with me. The fact that DE hasn't noticed this issue IS A BIGGER ISSUE,  there is no point in getting Loki anymore. Knowing DE I wouldn't be surprised if they made an augment for her 3 that disarmed enemies. What would some solutions be? Fucc if I know, u tell me. They could re-work wisp's 2, they could completely rework Loki, they could give Loki better assets then wisp (don't tell me ur not looking at mesa's badonkadonks when ur spamming 4 or use ivara's agile on valkyr) . I don't know if this is even a big enough problem for DE to really care, hell I know YOU don't even care (kudos if u got this far) if this problem is even a problem, how could it be fixed?

First, I have no idea what Frame to get. I am thinking of Wisp because she looks cool 😉 (Like she THICC). 

But I am more of a melee person and not sure if any of her abilities would be helpful. I feel the only thing that could partially be helpful in melee is the 2 and the 3. The 2 (I think it is the teleport thing) so I can get out of sticky situations. 3 because it has AoE. Is there a way to use Wisp’s abilities for offensive style instead of support style?

Melee weapon wise, I have already chose to use the Dual Ether Swords. But I do want the Dual Kamas. But I don’t have any Kamas so I can’t craft it right now.

Primary, I’m looking at the Arca Plasmor. But I am not that high of a Mastery rank yet. So I don’t know what to get. But I am rarely going to use my primary and my secondary. 

Secondary, I don’t know.

964,Grineer weapon concept: JT5-MADAGRUA,1563813230.0,8,"First off, creds to whoever guesses what Madagrua means (translated from Grineer to English)

===The premise===

If Bob Ross painted a primary weapon to match the Jat Kittag (Because everybody needs a friend) the JT5-Madagrua's probably what he would've come up with. But I hear you asking,

""Ok, I can see a jet powered hammer, but a jet powered MACHINE GUN AND SNIPER RIFLE?!? WHY?!?""

(First off it's a solution for low-T but that's beside the point.)

The main answer is a simple concept: Infinite ammo. In Warframe it's a trick several weapons and mods can pull off, but sometimes with no explanation as to where in the hell the ammo's actually coming from. The JT5 (Also called ""Mad Jat"" by certain Grineer) approaches this problem by using carbon in the atmosphere to fabricate either of two kinds of ammunition non-stop. The drawbacks? Well.... Let's just say it's stuck in its prototype phase for a reason.

===How it looks, how it works===

The JT5 has a bottom-mounted jet intake slightly to the left of the barrel. Don't worry, an improvement from the JT4 uses the jet's action to cycle coolant through a newly added outer shell on the intake, allowing for safer handling and aggressive sustained counterfire. (GRRRAAAAAAAKATAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!). Here, Carbon from the atmosphere is used to make either carbyne or diamond rounds, dependant of course on the weapon's firing mode. For propulsion, carbon and nitrogen gas along with hydrogen and oxygen derived from moisture in the air is used to fabricate trace ammounts of trinitrotoluene, commonly known as TNT. (Fun fact: Testers of the JT4 became known as ""Fusrodanians"" after several models exploded on the test range, this on account of the aforementioned lack of cooling around the intake, and an over-condensed design with the ammo stored right beside a tube of burning jet fuel.)

The intake feeds into an 6 piston compression system on top-left of the gun where the bullets are fabricated at a rate of 6 rounds a second. Be sure to store your Mad Jat prototype with these pistons faced away from any surface that might be hard or resiliant enough to propel the JT5 away from said surface, just in case the mechanism should accidentally start without prompt. One guy lost a leg over that, while it's a relatively small hazard compared to the JT4 we still pride ourselves on our safety managment protocols.

Up and right of the barrel is the repositioned ammo bay. This consists of 4 compartments, which combined hold 32 carbyne rounds (full-auto) or 4 diamond slugs (single fire). Once every 5 and 1/3 seconds, if all bays are full, the system will produce and eject an ammo drop containing either 32 rifle rounds or 4 sniper rounds for you and your allies to use. ""But if the JT5 can hold 32 extra rounds in reserve to make an ammo drop with, why doesn't it just hold 32 extra rounds for me to fire?"" Answer: Because the JT4 did that, and we found out only half of the exploded test subjects died from a lack of coolant. Hence the overload storage.

NOTE: To prevent jamming (ala shoving a diamond slug down a barrel meant for a MUCH smaller carbyn round) the Madagrua will EJECT ALL AMMO BAYS immedietely upon switching firing modes. These can be picked up by your teammates as ammo drops.

CONCLAVE WARNING: These ammo drops can also be picked up by your enemies. Infinite ammo comes at a cost.

===Full-auto===

At full bore, the JT5 can spit tenno- and infested- consuming fire at an even 10 rounds a second, but the light weight of the carbyne rounds leads to heavy damage fall off at about twice the range a shotgun can effectively reach, made up for mostly by its precision aim, fire rate, and 20% status chance. These rounds deal primarily slash damage, and are excellent for crowd control work.

===Single-fire===

Corpus? What Corpus? Or rebel Grineer for that matter?! The JT5-Madagrua produces one 20% crit chance slug every 1 and 1/3 seconds. The shape of these rounds lend themselves to high impact and puncture damage, at the cost of effectively 0 slash damage. Glappid-Pro's #1 choice for hemocyte hunting... or at least it would've been had the gun ever been mass produced.

Note: Due to the non-stop operation of the reloading mechanism, the JT5 isn't just *alarmingly* loud, it's constantly so (partly the reason for the name ""Mad Jat""). Having this weapon unholstered will emit the continuous sound of its manufacturing pistons, which are audible across almost any room you walk into. Mods that lessen the sound of shots being fired do not affect this mechanism.",0
965,"Need help building Titania for Diwata (Razorwing melee). Yes, Dex Pixia is preferred by the meta but I don't care.",1563821039.0,10,"Backstory: I just unlocked Titania this past weekend, mainly because I couldn't be arsed to find Dragonlilies on Earth night tileset. Mea culpa.

So I began playing with her, thoroughly underwhelmed, until I unlocked Razorwing. Then I was underwhelmed because I was basically playing Archwing but in closed maps. Then I started being whelmed and then downright overwhelmed when I realized how much more fun the flight system was when I had higher target density and lots of obstacles to navigate.

Then I started using Diwata.

Now by all accounts, Diwata doesn't scale well at all, even by comparison to Dex Pixia (let alone Titania overall). I'm not denying that. It's great for sub-50 trash mobs, and that's about it. I get it. Not every frame is a meta beast.

But dammit, Archwing melee- I mean Razorwing melee is just such a rush. The ""lock-on"" mechanic is sometimes wonky, sure, more often than not if I'm being honest, but when it works... It's just such a great feeling when a door slams open and the next thing the mass of Grineer on the other side know, there's a swarm of bugs and one very angry smolfram blitzing unopposed through their ranks. And lord, when the lock mechanic DOES work... I'm zipping from target to target, up and down the hallway, just slicing down everything that moves. To be fair, I do use Dex Pixia as a ""close in weapon"" to soften up a mob before I reach it, and also to tamp down Nullifier bubbles (REEEEEE), but against all advice... I prefer to do my work up close and personal.

So... How do I keep her melee competitive (and no, ""just use Dex Pixia"" isn't an option for me, otherwise I'll just use another frame)?

That's not rhetorical, I'm actually asking. For reference of what I have, I pretty much threw survivability mods out the window (if she gets targeted and HIT, she's pretty much dead anyways) in favor of duration and ability strength to maximize Razorwing weapons and my ability to be in it all round. I also have a bunch of pieces of the Gladiator set between the frame itself (Aegis) and both her equipped melee weapon and Diwata to try to max out the set bonus of melee crit chance with combo meter, and likewise have Diwata built for crit with Berserker as a bonus (but only have three bars filled). Still trying to get the other pieces of Gladiator, as well as Blood Rush. L

Unfortunately, this does have a bit of a ""spool up time"" where I have to slice through a bunch of trash to get my mult up before I start seeing lots of colored numbers (Diwata caps at like 40% CC with non-primed (is there a Primed version?) true steel or whatever the melee CC mod is). Aura is Corrosive Projection, was convinced by reading up that it was much more important than Steel Charge seemed to be.

So in sum, the mods on her are

- Gladiator Aegis (solely for the set bonus, not for armor obviously)

- Flow

- Intensify (need Primed!)

- Continuity

- Augur Message

- Vigilante Pursuit (mainly to help guide me when my Diwata charges throw me into a corner, probably should forma and stick something else in)

- and... Two others I can't think of at the moment and I'm at work so can't check. I think one is maybe the shield recharge delay one (I suck at remembering some mod names), the idea being that when I AM grazed by enemy fire or damaged by aoe I can rapidly regain my safety net.

I think I might see a way forward in getting Narrow Minded since it increases duration in lieu of range (non factor for Razorwing), then I can drop the current pair of Primed Continuity and Augur Message I stuck on (the difference should be made up by the single NM, I think) which will then allow me to stick on something else. Have to find it first, but....

Anyways, pretty sure my only visible way forward from there would be to use the spare slot for Blind Rage (don't have yet either) or Transient Fortitude (this one I DO have), the former preferred since it only affects the ""startup cost"" of Razorwing. Then, hell, depending on endurance I might be able to use TF in place of Pursuit.

Edit: though as a point of personal pride, I took her through the last Sortie, and did second most damage during the Lephantis assassination (low 30s, someone else had high 30s). Just popped energy pancakes to stay up. Might not have been as efficient as it could have been, and yes, I was using the Dex Pixia (obviously), but bullcrap she isn't viable for higher level content.",0

Anyway, this may not sound impressive - but I don't have any waybounds other than Zenurik and no other schools unlocked. No Madurai, no Unairu. 
I think that what made this run different was that I got a full set of Arcane Nullifiers and the fact I started investing into Virtuos Strike (rank 1).
I use Volt Prime (255% duration, Corrosive Projection) and Rubico Prime and on top of that I have four Vigilante mods which give me 20% chance to upgrade my crits. I'm thinking of getting a crit Kavat though.
My amp is 223.

Now I'll be soon switching lenses on my focus farm frame and I'm not sure what to prioritise. I know, Madurai, but I was thinking of getting some waybounds done first (health ones from Vazarin, armor from Unairu). Lenses grind is real though, so after getting an Eidolon lens I would spend time unlocking that school. So maybe I should do Madurai first but that leads to the question...

Can I survive trido (in a squad) with only Zenurik waybounds and using Madurai? I would get other waybounds after I get what I want from Madurai.
